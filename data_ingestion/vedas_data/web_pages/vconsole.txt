WMS API
Access high-quality geospatial imagery with our WMS API, offering False Color Composite (FCC) data for
                AWIFS(Resourceset) and Sentinel-2,
                as well as True Color Composite (TCC) for Sentinel-2. This API enables users to view imagery for any
                specific date or
                instantaneously temporal composites over a desired timeframe, creating seamless mosaics tailored to your
                needs.
                Whether you're a researcher or a developer,
                the WMS API provides flexible and reliable satellite imagery for visualizing temporal changes in
                landscapes.
Temporal API
Unlock detailed vegetation analysis with the Temporal API. This API delivers Normalized Difference
                Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series data for specific point locations and polygonal regions. Users can
                analyze vegetation health trends and calculate temporal metrics over desired timeframes, leveraging
                Sentinel-2's high-resolution imagery. Ideal for agriculture, ecology, and land-use studies, this API
                empowers users to track vegetation dynamics with precision and ease. In future more temporal datasets
                will be made available through this API.
