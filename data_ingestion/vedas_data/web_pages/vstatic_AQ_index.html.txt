Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) (or Aerosol Optical Thickness) is the measure
						of aerosols (particles suspended in the air) distributed with in the column of air from
						instrument to top of the atmosphere or from space-borne sensor to surface. AOD is the degree to
						which particles in air (aerosols) prevent the transmission of light by absorption and scattering
						of sun light and is defined as integrated extinction coefficient over a vertical atmospheric
						column of unit cross-section. As Aerosols prevent the transmission of light by absorption and
						scattering of sun light therefore reduces the visibility.
⋄ AOD < 0.1 represents "clean atmosphere" (clear blue sky, bright sun
							and maximum visibility).
⋄ 0.1 < AOD < 0.5 represents "moderately hazy atmosphere"
									(moderate pollution and visibility).
⋄ As AOD increases to greater than 0.5, distribution
										of
										particles in the air become so dense that sun is obscured (very low visibility,
										highly
										polluted atmosphere).
