Forecast
Forecast
Due to the growing demand of renewable energy, photovoltaic (PV) generation systems have
                            increased considerably in recent years. Solar
                            Insolation forecasting technology plays a very important role since depending on the
                            accuracy of
                            prediction, the amount of economic benefits from solar energy is significantly different.

                            To cater the need of PV farm operators, Next 72 hours forecast (15-min interval) of
                            solar insolation and temperature, next 72 hours wind and relative humidity forecast (3 hours interval) are generated on daily basis using Numerical Weather Predication
                            model (NWP). These forecast datasets are published as OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) compliant Time enabled Web Map Services (WMS) and animation
                            for same is also available on VEDAS.
Wind energy :
Wind energy :
Wind energy is the second fastest growing source of electricity in the world. Harnessing
                            energy from wind and converting into electricity has several advantages. So to exploit wind
                            energy from vast coastline of India which cover 7600 km and land, the VEDAS web-portal
                            provides information on monthly wind energy potential. The ocean wind energy is derived from scatterometer data. 
                            Indiaâ€™s Oeansat -2 OSCAT, an active Ku-band (13.515 GHz) microwave payload, and QSCAT provide data to retrieve wind speed and direction.
                             OSCAT has a spatial resolution of 50 kmThe interface is designed to
                            assess monthly average wind power potential. Wind forecast for next 72 hours at 3-hour interval generated from
                            Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model is also available under forecast tab.
Wave Energy :
Wave Energy :
Ocean wave has enormous energy potential and it is harnessed from sea waves. It is one
                        of the most sustainable energy source. The rigorous vertical motion of sea waves
                        contains lot of kinetic energy which can be further use for electricity generation,
                        desalinization of water etc. To exploit wave energy, VEDAS provides information about
                        wave height, wave power and wave periods in form of WMS Services.
