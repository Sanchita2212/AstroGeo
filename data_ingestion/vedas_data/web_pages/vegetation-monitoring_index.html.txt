--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Vegetation is a very complex eco-system and is influenced by, besides
						management practices, many environmental factors
						such temperature, rainfall, soil moisture. A web-based geo-spatial processing and visualization
						system is developed
						to assist practitioners and resource managers in making informed decisions about current season
						vegetation performance.
Actual field level information is sparce and not available in near-real
						time. To overcome the limitation of timely availability
						of field information, it is a recent trend to use information derived from space borne platform
						which provides repetitive
						and synoptic coverage of area. One of the most important indicators of evaluating performance of
						vegetation is the
						Normalised Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI) which is ratio of difference of NIR and red
						reflectance over their sum.
						Vast amount of historical and current data on NDVI is available from various sensors such as
						AWiFS, OCM, MODIS, PROBA.
						It is well known that there are considerable year to year variations in performance of
						vegetation system – mainly due
						to changing crop growing conditions. To account for them, information on temperature, rainfall
						and soil moisture is
						also provided.
The main outcome of the developed system is the platform it provides for
						monitoring of crop growth. With the use of
						developed web-based platform and analytical functionalities, it is possible to infer vegetation
						condition at various
						spatial and temporal scales. It is possible to compare area / region that is deviating from the
						average and / or particular
						year along with temperature and moisture condition. The developed web-GIS analysis platform can
						be exploited by the
						stake holders to make informed policy and / or management interventions at the right time.
There are three sections on this webpage (on Bottom strip). The section on
						reference layers has static information such
						as SOI administrative boundaries, Infrastructure (roads, railway lines), India mosaics prepared
						using microwave and
						optical data, DEM and rivers. Under “data visualization”, historical as well as most recent
						image data (Indian as well
						as global) of NDVI, Soil Moisture, Rainfall, Temperature are populated. Under “data analysis”,
						web based geospatial
						processing / functionalities for NDVI difference, range analysis, temporal classification, long
						term statistics can
						be performed on web.
