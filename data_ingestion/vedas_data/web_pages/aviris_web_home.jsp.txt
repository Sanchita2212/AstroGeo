AVIRIS-NG Phase – 2 Airborne campaign commenced from 24th Feb, 2018.
Space Applications Centre (SAC), Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO),
                                            Department of Space (DOS), Government of India, declares an “Announcement of
                                            Opportunity (AO)” to carry out scientific research for the utilisation of science data to be
                                            acquired from Airborne flights of Hyperspectral sensor called AVIRIS Next Generation
                                            (NG) over India in collaboration with Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), NASA.
The AVIRIS-NG flights for phase -1 over Indian sub‐continent were conducted during October – November, 2015 and
                                            January ‐ February, 2016. Presently, this AO is targeted towards utilizing the data to be
                                            acquired from AVIRIS NG flights. To know more about AVIRIS-NG Phase-1 Campaign Click Here (PDF Size:1566KB Language: English)
AVIRIS-NG phase-2 campaign  is divided into two parts: Phase - 2A and Phase - 2B. To know more about AVIRIS-NG Phase-2 Campaign Click Here (PDF Size:457KB Language: English)
The AVIRIS‐NG can take observations over a continuous electromagnetic spectrum spread
                                            over 380 – 2510 nm at 5 nm band interval. This is capable of providing hyperspectral
                                            observations at 6 m pixel resolution over a flight swath of 6 km when the flight altitude is
                                            about 6 – 7 km.
In the past, ISRO has developed and launched hyperspectral satellite sensor such as HySI in Indian Mini Satellite 1 (IMS‐1) mission and Chandrayan‐1 mission. 
                                            In the past ISRO has carried out hyperspectral applications using ground, airborne and space borne sensors in various fields.
