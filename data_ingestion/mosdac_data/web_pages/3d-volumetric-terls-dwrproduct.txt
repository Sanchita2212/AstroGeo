3D Volumetric TERLS DWRproduct
These products contain the 3D volumetric gridded de-cluttered radar reflectivity and de-aliased radial velocity generated from the C-Band Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) DWR Volumetric PPI Scan data. The data grid has dimensions of (81x481x481) with a horizontal resolution of (1 km x 1 km) and vertical resolution of (250 m). The maximum altitude considered in while gridding is 20.0 km. This product can be used for various hydrological and numerical weather prediction applications.
Data Access
Data Version
Version 1.0 (beta)
Data Sources
TERLS C-Band Doppler Weather Radar (dprf mode)
Processing Steps
Following are the three major processing steps :
- The radar reflectivity data is corrected for clutter using a combination of spatial continuity filter and fuzzy-logic based echo classification algorithm.
-  The radial velocity data is dealiased using a 2D multipass velocity dealiasing scheme based spatial continuity of velocity fields
-  The corrected reflectivity and radial velocity from all elevations is then gridded into a 3D volumetric grid having resolution of 250 x 1 km x 1 km.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
Decluttering of Radar reflectivity and Dealiasing of radial velocity; 3D volumetric gridding of radar variables as explained in detail in the above mentioned reports.
