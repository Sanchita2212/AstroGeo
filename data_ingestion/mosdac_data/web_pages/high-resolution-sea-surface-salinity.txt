High Resolution Sea Surface Salinity

Data Access
Data Version
Version 1.0 (beta).
Data Sources
SMAP Sea Surface Salinity ( https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/SMAP_JPL_L3_SSS_CAP_8DAY-RUNNINGMEAN_V5 ) Altimetry-derived sea surface currents ( https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_MY_008_047/ ).
Processing Steps
i. Remap Sea Surface Currents with a spatial resolution of 5 km.
ii. Backward advection of particles from the final time {t} rsub {f} to the initial time {t} rsub {f} -14 , where 14 is the number of days the particles are advected using Runge-Kutta 4th order method.
iii. The SMAP Sea Surface Salinity observed at {t} rsub {f} -14 is interpolated onto the particle positions that day.
iv. With this, each particle has an SSS value on {t} rsub {f} day that corresponds to the observation at {t} rsub {f} -14 .

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
The algorithm is called Lagrangian Reconstruction Technique. User should refer [1].
Limitations
This algorithm is applicable only in the region with moderate to high eddy kinetic energy and where lateral advection dominates. High resolution sea surface salinity product generated by Lagrangian technique can have error due to tracer bias (depends on accuracy of initial conditions) and advection bias (Passive stirring can introduce bias due to mixing physics (air-sea fluxes, mixing etc.)).
Known problems with data
Data sets have biases as well as inaccuracy.

This is achieved through the utilization of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, in conjunction with sea surface currents obtained from altimetry. By employing forward and backward schemes for the numerical advection of SMAP SSS fields using altimeter-derived geostrophic currents, a Lagrangian reconstruction is produced, capturing smaller-scale features. The reliability of our in-house developed algorithm is assessed by comparing it with an available reconstructed product in the Gulf Stream. Additionally, a preliminary validation is conducted against insitu data obtained from a thermo-salinograph.
