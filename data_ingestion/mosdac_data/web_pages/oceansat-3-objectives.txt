OCEANSAT-3 Objectives
To ensure the data continuity of Ocean colour and wind vector data to sustain the operational applications.
To ensure the data continuity of Ocean colour and wind vector data to sustain the operational applications.
To improve the applications, some additional datasets such as Sea Surface Temperature and more number of bands in Optical region for florescence and in Infrared region for atmospheric corrections are accommodated.
To develop / improve related algorithms and data products to serve in well- established application areas and to enhance the mission utility.
