INSAT-3A Payloads
Communication Payload
1 2 Normal C-band transponders (9 channels provide expanded coverage from Middle East to South East Asia with an EIRP of 38 dBW, 3 channels provide India coverage with an EIRP of 36 dBW and 6 Extended C-band transponders provide India coverage with an EIRP of 36 dBW).
6 upper extended C-band transponders having India beam coverage providing an EoC-EIRP of 37 dBW.
6 Ku-band transponders provide India coverage with EIRP of 48 dBW.
Meteorological Payload
A Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) with imaging capacity in the visible (0.55-0.75 μm), thermal infrared (10.5-12.5 μm) and Water Vapour (5.7-7.1 μm) channels, provide 2x2 km, 8x8 km and 8x8 km ground resolutions respectively.
A CCD camera provides 1x1 km ground resolution, in the visible (0.63-0.69 μm), near infrared (0.77-0.86 μm) and shortwave infrared (1.55-1.70 μm) bands.
A Data Relay Transponder (DRT) having global receive coverage with a 400 MHz uplink and 4500 MHz downlink for relay of meteorological, hydrological and oceanographic data from unattended land and ocean-based automatic data collection-cum-transmission platforms.
A Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS&R) SARP payload having global receive coverage with 406 MHz uplink and 4500 MHz downlink with India coverage, for relay of signals from distress beacons in sea, air or land.
