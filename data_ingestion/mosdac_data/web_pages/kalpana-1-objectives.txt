KALPANA-1 Objectives
M ajor Metsat/Kalpana mission objectives are:-
To establish a small satellite I-1000 bus system which can meet the exclusive service requirements of a meteorological payload for earth imageries
Collection of weather data from low cost unattended data collection platforms-to configure Metsat spacecraft within the lift-off mass constraints of upgraded existing polar satellite launch vehicle for deployment in geo-synchronous transfer orbit (GTO) mission.
