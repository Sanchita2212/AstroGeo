Processing Steps
Using the daily gridded data of MADT, Vector winds and SST data the Geostrophic, wind driven and buoyancy components of the ocean surface current respectively are first calculated for the off-equatorial regions (3°N to 90°N and 3°S to 90°S).
Using the polynomial expansion the equatorial currents (±3° latitude band) are derived.
The daily ocean surface current at 0.25° resolution is then derived by applying a linear weighted average procedure to the equatorial and off equatorial current solutions with in the latitude band of ± 3° to ± 4° band.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
The methodology follows the work of Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002). The basic equations are those of quasi linear and steady flow in a surface layer where the horizontal velocity U = (u,v) is allowed to vary with vertical coordinate z , and where vertical turbulent mixing is characterized by an eddy viscosity A uniform with depth. The vertical shear U z reaches zero at a constant scaling depth z = - H . Using complex notations U(x,y,z,t) = u + iv and ∇ = ∂/∂x + i ∂/∂y , the basic equations are if U = - (1/ρ m ) ∇ p + AU z (1a) (1/ρm) p z = -g + ∇θ (1b) ∇θ = g χ T ∇SST , (1c)
with - H ≤ z ≤ 0, and subject to the following boundary conditions U z (z=0) = τ / A (2a) U z (z = -H) = 0 (2b)
The characteristic density is ρ m = 1025 kg m -3 ,
The acceleration due to gravity g = 9.8 m s -2 ,
and the coefficient of thermal expansion χT = 3 x 10 -4 K -1 ,
The vector field τ = τ x + i τ y represents the surface wind stress divided by ρ m ,
H has been chosen to be 70 m,
The parameter A is chosen by the empirical formulation as A = a (|W|/W1) b | w| 1 m s -1 where W 1 = 1 m s -1 , a = 8 x 10 -5 m 2 s -1 , and b = 2.2
where W 1 = 1 m s -1 , a = 8 x 10 -5 m 2 s -1 , and b = 2.2 .
The equation for the velocity shear is
which is a second-order differential equation in velocity shear Uz , subject to the boundary conditions (2a,b). After solving for the shear profiles, one can find an expression for the velocity at the surface, which is
Here the function q is defined by q (x) = x /tanh (x) and h e = (A/if ) 1/2 is complex and its modulus is proportional to the Ekman depth h e = sqrt( 2A/|f|).

Using equation (4) and the datasets mentioned above, the daily ocean surface currents were generated. Equatorial velocities (±3° latitude band) are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials as described in Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002).
Limitations
As the equatorial currents are estimated through an approximation procedure using polynomial coefficients the correlation with in-situ currents in the equatorial region is observed to be relatively poorer especially for the meridional currents.
Known problems with data
As these input satellite data are not very reliable near to the coast, the estimated currents very near to the coast may also have problems.
