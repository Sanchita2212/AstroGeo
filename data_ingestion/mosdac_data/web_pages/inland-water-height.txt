Inland Water Height

Data Access

Processing Steps
Firstly the waveforms are classified based on their signature, and then these waveforms are retracked with the suitable retracker.
Dedicated inland range correction algorithms are required to account for the atmospheric delays.Detailed information about the processing can be found in (S. Chanderet. al. 2014, A .Dubey et. al. 2014).

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
The water level over the inland water bodies can be retrieved using altimeter waveforms data.
The range information is estimated based on the arrival time of the radar pulse.
This range is then corrected for Dry tropospheric correction, wet tropospheric correction, ionospheric correction, and tidal correction, i.e. Load tide, solid earth tide.
Detailed information about the range corrections can be found in the ATBD document (S. Chander and Prakash Chauhan, 2013) of the SARAL mission.
Limitations
Based on the availability of the Altimeter dataset over the study region (Data Gap, altimeter track loss, bad weather, etc.).
Known problems with data
Data problems due to bad weather (heavy rain)
Related data collections
GPS Field trip for water level measurement was conducted over Ukai reservoir on 9th November 2013, 17th January 2014 and 2nd January 2015.
Brahmaputra observed river water level data was collected for 6 locations from upstream to downstream from Inland Waterways Authority (IWAI) and Central Water Commission (CWC) along with the satellite pass synchronous field trips.
