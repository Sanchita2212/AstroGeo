Oceansat-2 Objectives
T he Indian satellite Oceansat-2 is designed to provide service continuity for operational users of the Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM)instrument on Oceansat-1. It will also enhance the potential of applications in other areas. The main objectives of OceanSat-2 are to study surface winds and ocean surface strata, observation of chlorophyll concentrations, monitoring of phytoplankton blooms, study of atmospheric aerosols and suspended sediments in the water.
The primary mission objectives of Oceansat-2 are:
To design, develop, launch and operate a three axis stabilized spacecraft carrying an Ocean Colour Monitor and Ku-band Scatterometer,
To develop / implement algorithms for retrieval of geophysical parameters like wind vector on an operational basis.
To promote new applications in the areas of ocean studies including prediction of cyclone trajectory, fisheries, coastal zone mapping etc.
Oceansat-2 gathers systematic data for oceanographic, coastal and atmospheric applications. The main objectives of OceanSat-2 are to study surface winds and ocean surface strata, observation of chlorophyll concentrations, monitoring of phytoplankton blooms, study of atmospheric aerosols and suspended sediments in the water.
Oceansat-2 carries two payloads for ocean related studies, namely, Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) and Ku-band Pencil Beam Scatterometer. An additional piggy-back payload called ROSA (Radio Occultation Sounder for Atmospheric studies) developed by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) is also included. The major applications of data from Oceansat-2 are identification of potential fishing zones, sea state forecasting, coastal zone studies and inputs for weather forecasting and climatic studies.
