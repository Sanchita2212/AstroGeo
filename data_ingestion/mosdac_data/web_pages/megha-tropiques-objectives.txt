Megha Tropiques Objectives
T he main objective of the Megha-Tropiques mission is to study the convective systems that influence the tropical weather and climate. The Megha-Tropiques mission goals are as follows:
To provide, simultaneous measurements of several elements of the atmospheric water cycle (water vapour, clouds, condensed water in clouds, precipitation and evaporation),
To measure the corresponding radiative budget at the top of the atmosphere,
To ensure high temporal sampling in order to characterize the life cycle of the convective systems and to obtain significant statistics.
The payloads have swaths of around 1700-200km. It is necessary to measure the above parameters for a minimum duration of 3 years in order to observe the inter-annual variability and getting an opportunity to observe El Nino-type events in the tropics.
The satellite is launched into a non-sun synchronous orbit, unlike other IRS spacecraft. This Megha-Tropiques satellite carries four payloads namely, MADRAS-a microwave imager, SAPHIR-scanning radiometer instrument, SCARAB-scanner for radiative budget and GPS occultation receiver for atmospheric studies. The major orbit parameters are:
