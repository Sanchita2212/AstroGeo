Oceansat-3 Introduction
ISRO has launched the EOS-06(Oceansat-3) satellite on 26 Nov 2022 in a polar sun-synchronous orbit at 740km altitude. EOS-06(Oceansat-3) is the third-generation satellite in the Oceansat series. This is to provide continuity services of Oceansat-2 spacecraft with enhanced payload specifications as well as application areas.
EOS-06(Oceansat-3) has three main instruments, 13-band advanced Ocean Colour Monitor, Ku-band Scatterometer and a 2-channel Sea Surface Temperature Monitor. ARGOS is the fourth provided by French Space Agency (CNES). Unfortunately, the SSTM developed a technical problem in scan mechanism and therefore, not in operation at present.
Payloads on EOS-06(Oceansat-3) are :

• Ku-band Scatterometer (SCAT-3)

• 13-band Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM-3)

• 2-band Sea Surface Temperature Monitor (SSTM)

• ARGOS by CNES French Space Agency
Applications planned using EOS-06(Oceansat-3) datasets are as follows :
Marine Resource Management
Carbon & Nitrogen Cycling in Ocean
Phytoplankton biodiversity
Zooplankton & secondary pro
Algal bloom detection and monitoring
Climate change studies
Phytoplankton physiology
Atmosphere-Ocean processes and biological productivity
Sediment dynamics & fluvial fluxes in coastal ocean
Submarine applications
Biogeochemical modelling
Air quality dynamics from Oceansat -3
Coral reef ecosystem studies
Land surface NDVI/LST
Cryospheric Science
Assimilation of ocean surface winds in NWP models
Monsoon onset
Cyclogenesis, track prediction, intensification
Studies of ocean surface waves
Modeling surface currents
Assimilation of winds in coupled ocean circulations models,
Winds and its effect on oceanic mixed layer
Air-sea interactions
Large-scale soil moisture estimation
Vegetation classifications and their growth assessment.
