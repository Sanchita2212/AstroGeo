Wave based Renewable Energy

Data Access
Data Version
Version 1.0 (beta)
Data Sources
The significant wave height (SWH) and wind speed for both the altimeters are taken from Jason-2 ( http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com ) SARAL/ALTIKA ( http://www.mosdac.gov.in )
Jason-2 ( http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com )
SARAL/ALTIKA ( http://www.mosdac.gov.in )
Processing Steps
Using Significant Wave Height (SWH) and wind speed, the wave period is derived based on the data adaptive technique of " Genetic Algorithm " (Remya et al. 2011)

Wave period hence derived is validated using buoy observations from Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS)

Wave power is derived based on SWH and estimated wave period

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
The wave power (P) is mathematically derived as

Where P is Wave power per unit of wave-crest length (in Kilowatt/m) R represents the satellite range H m0 is the significant wave height (in meters) T is wave period (in seconds) ρ is the density of water (in kilogram/cubic meter) g is the acceleration due to gravity (in meters/square seconds)
P is Wave power per unit of wave-crest length (in Kilowatt/m)
R represents the satellite range
H m0 is the significant wave height (in meters)
T is wave period (in seconds)
ρ is the density of water (in kilogram/cubic meter)
g is the acceleration due to gravity (in meters/square seconds)
Limitations
The products have gaps as they are based purely on track altimeters data.
Known problems with data
Data problems due to bad weather (heavy rain)
