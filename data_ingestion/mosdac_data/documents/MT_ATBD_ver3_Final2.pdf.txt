Introduction 
 
Megha-Tropiques (MT) a satellite realized under ISRO-CNES collaborative 
mission was launched on October 12, 2011 using ISRO’s PSLV (Polar Satellite 
Launch Vehicle) in an inclined 20 orbit at an altitude of 867 km to understand the 
energy and water cycles in the global tropical region. The MT satellite frequently 
measures radiation emitted by the Earth-Atmosphere System in the visible, 
infrared and microwave spectrum through its four sensors onboard namely, 
MADRAS (Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric 
Structures), SAPHIR (Sondeur Atmosphérique du Profil d'Humidité Intertropical 
par Radiométrie), ScaRaB (Scanner for Radiation Budget) and ROSA (Radio 
Occultation Sensor for Atmosphere). The MADRAS system is a five-channel 
(18.7 GHz, 23.8 GHz, 36.5 GHz, 89 GHz and 157 GHz), dual polarized (except 
23.8 GHz), self-calibrating, microwave radiometer system with azimuth scanning 
of 65 yielding data swath of 1700 kms at local incidence angle of 53.5 at the 
Earth’s surface. The SAPHIR sensor is a microwave humidity sounder operating 
around 183.31 GHz with six-channels (±0.2, ±1.1, ±2.8, ±4.2, ±6.8 and ±11 GHz) 
with cross-track scanning of 43 yielding data swath of 1705 Km with variable 
local incidence angle at the Earth’s surface. The ScaRaB sensor operates in four 
bands (0.55-0.65 m, 0.2-4.0 m, 0.2-50.0 m and 10.5-12.5 m) with a swath of 
2242 km with cross-track scanning of  48.9. ROSA tracks the dual-frequency L-
band signals, transmitted by the GPS-GNSS, in both the fore and aft direction 
from limb sounding geometry giving 1-dimensional (vertical) profile of 
geophysical parameters at various geo-locations of the earth. 
 
 
The major task is the retrieval of various geophysical parameters from MT sensors 
involving complexities of the inverse problem and the characteristics of the 
instruments. This draft document describes the theoretical basis of the algorithms 
for retrieving various geophysical parameters from these sensors. These 
algorithms are planned for the implementation on the operational basis for 
geophysical data product generation from MT satellite data. Algorithms for each 
sensor are provided in separate sections as presented in this document.

ATBD for Rainfall Retrieval from MADRAS 
2.2 Introduction 
  
Rainfall is a highly discontinuous process both in space and time. Accurate 
and reliable measurements of rainfall over extensive areas of oceans present a 
formidable challenge to meteorologists. In addition to large uncertainties in the 
derived estimates, there are problems related to nonuniformities of coverage, 
quality and logistics of operations etc. The global observations and monitoring of 
clouds from space using remote sensing techniques, has the potential of providing 
global rainfall information on desired time and space scales (Kummerow et al. 
1995, Adler et al. 1994). Precipitation is associated with various atmospheric 
phenomena both in small and large scale. Assessment of precipitation contributes 
to improve weather forecasting, in small and large spatial scales, and a study of 
global rainfall leads to better understanding of global climate variability. 
In addition, one of the strongest links between ocean, land and atmosphere 
is the fresh water fluxes due to evaporation and precipitation process. Evaporation 
("E") controls the loss of fresh water and precipitation ("P") governs most of the 
gain of fresh water. Inputs from rivers and melting ice can also contribute to fresh 
water gains. Evaporation minus precipitation is usually referred to as the net flux 
of fresh water or the total fresh water in or out of the oceans and can be 
determined from satellite remotes sensing methods (Gairola et al. 2007). E-P 
determines surface salinity of the ocean, which helps determine the stability of the 
water column. Salinity and temperature determine the density of ocean water, and 
density influences the circulation. Precipitation also affects the height of the ocean 
surface indirectly via salinity and density. The global increase in oceanic 
evaporation (E) is determined by the increase in surface heating and this controls 
the global increase in precipitation (P). With the global warming scenario, it has 
been argued that increased moisture content of the atmosphere favours stronger 
rainfall events, thus increasing risk of flooding over land and more fresh water 
fluxes (E-P) over the oceans. It changes the buoyancy of the sea waters and also 
acts as a forcing function in OGCM.

The development of rainfall estimation techniques based on remote 
sensing measurements from space has registered tremendous progress and realistic 
achievements over the last three decades. Like any other fields of endeavor, 
however, there are limitations too and newer and better measurement and 
estimation techniques are developed on a continuous basis. The ability of space 
based  measurements to provide a 2-D distribution of rainfall over large areas with 
sufficiently frequent sampling in time, especially over data sparse oceanic regions, 
facilitates us with a tremendously powerful tool to detect, closely monitor 
monsoon system and study the genesis and evolution of the furious tropical 
cyclonic storm. 
Most tropical rainfall that has an impact over more than world's two-third 
population occurs as a result of convective processes.  Understanding rainfall and 
its variability will contribute significantly to making reliable monsoon forecast. In 
addition, the knowledge of precipitation as one of the initial state of the 
atmosphere is necessary in weather prediction for  physical  initialization of 
numerical models. For years the need for diabetic initialization of precipitation in 
numerical models is being fulfilled by the infrared measurements by polar and 
geostationary satellites, since IR/VI measurements are continuously available with 
larger viewing areas and high resolution. 
  
Microwaves  can penetrate clouds and to some extent rain, and thus 
provide another source for rainfall estimation over both land and oceans. Over the 
years, passive microwave (PM) instruments on earth orbiting platforms have been 
providing valuable information for precipitation estimation. The applications that 
benefited from microwave rainfall estimates include weather forecasting, climate 
analysis, and hydrological studies. The successful use of PM-based rain estimates 
in applications from various fields encourages the continuation of efforts toward 
the development of more advanced rain retrieval algorithms, despite obvious 
limitations associated with the low sampling frequency of orbiting platforms 
carrying PM sensors. The recent availability of detailed precipitation observations 
jointly obtained by the first space-borne precipitation radar (PR) and a 
multifrequncy passive microwave radiometer, the TRMM Microwave Imager 
(TMI), on NASA-USA and NASDA-Japan’s Tropical Rainfall Measuring 
Mission (TRMM) satellite offers an excellent opportunity for studying such 
issues. It  can also supplement the  observations from the IR/VIS measurements if 
properly integrated/unified and brings out the finer details than any one alone. 
 
 
2.2.1 Overview and Background: Measurement of Rain by Space-Based 
Methods: 
 
VIS/IR Measurements of Rain : 
Digital image data from polar orbiting and geostationary meteorological 
satellites with synoptic coverage and quasi-continuous sampling in time have now 
become the major tools for attempts to monitor rainfall from space. The most 
common and easily exploited image data - cloud images in the visible and thermal 
IR bands - provide reasonably direct information on cloud areal extent, cloud type 
and cloud growth and decay. However, cloud formation to rainfall is an involved 
process. The Visible/IR sensing from space does not permit direct measurement of 
raindrops and hence provides essentially indirect inferences from which useful 
estimates of rain falling below the cloud may be derived.

Encouraged by the overpowering advantages of spacebased observations, 
even these proxy indicators have been exploited to severe as a basis for 
development of a variety of techniques for estimation of rainfall. The basic 
assumption that underlies all rainfall estimation techniques which utilize satellite 
images in the Visible and IR band is that raining clouds can be distinguished from 
non-raining ones : the former are usually thick and tall producing high visible 
band reflectance and cold cloud top temperatures. The possible physical basis for 
this lies mainly in the fact that cold high clouds represent signatures of upward 
motion in  a locally saturated atmosphere indicating deep convection. 
The available schemes use visible and/or IR imagery and time evolution of 
cloud characteristics e.g. merging of cumulus clouds, cloud bands, anvils etc. seen 
in hourly/half hourly images. Many of these schemes are interactive in nature. 
Over the Indian region, monthly average rainfll information in the form of 
quantitative precipitation estimate (QPEs) maps with spatial resolution of 
2.50x2.50 are produced on a regular basis since 1986 using INSAT-VHRR IR 
images collected eight times daily (Arkin et al. 1989). These maps are produced 
following the Arkin and Miesner (1987) tecnique. Currently rainfall estimation 
from IR and Water Vapour channels of KALPANA and INSAT-3A are being 
utilized for the development of advanced algorithms for rainfall estimation over 
land and oceanic regions at 2.50x2.50 and sub-grid scale (0.250x0.250) by Gairola 
et al. (2007) by both GPI and INSAT Multi Spectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) 
(Gairola et al. 2007). 
  
Microwave Measurements of Rain: 
Satellite microwave radiometers have been successfully used to monitor 
the temporal and spatial variations of sea surface and atmospheric properties on 
global scale since the launch of the Soviet Cosmos-243 instrument in 1969. The 
process of using satellite data for such applications is complex. Grody (1993) 
provided a complete review of past, present and planned future satellite 
microwave 
instruments, 
including 
their 
operational 
characteristics 
and 
applications. Among all the geophysical parameters, rainfall is the most difficult 
parameter to be retrieved from satellite remote sensing due to the intermittent 
nature of the processes of rain occurrence and its highly complex 
emission/absorption and scattering properties. 
Microwave, due to their long wavelengths  achieve better penetration and 
interact strongly with the raindrops present in the cloud. These measurements 
provide a direct physical basis for rain estimation. Also microwaves are largely 
intensive to the presence of ice in thin cirrus clouds but only suffers its poor 
resolution capability. The precipitation monitoring capability of SSM/I has been 
demonstrated by many investigators. Wilheit et al. (1991) used multichannel 
microwave measurements for the rainfall retrieval. Negri et al. (1989) discussed 
meteorological interpretations with the false color images of 85 GHz (HH, VV) 
and 37 GHz (VV) for precipitation processes and clarification of land, ocean and 
sea ice types with SSM/I. Berg (1992) estimated and analyze inter-annual 
variations in the tropical oceanic rainfall using data from SSM/I. ).  
Microwave radiances reaching satellite altitudes from precipitating clouds 
containing aspherical ice, combined phase hydrometeors and the background 
atmosphere (cloud liquid water, water  vapor and gaseous constituents etc.) within 
the instrument field of view. The upwelling radiation observed by a microwave 
radiometer is expressed as an equivalent brightness temperature Tb and the ability 
Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 
10
of passive microwave radiometer to infer rainfall depends largely on the contrast 
between the observed brightness temperatures over raining and non-raining areas. 
Some of the sensitivity studies have been carried out through radiative transfer 
simulation by (Swaminathan et al. 2005, Deiveegan et al. 2007, Viltard et al. 
1998, Bauer et al. 1993, Gairola et al. 2001, 2005 etc) and through the empirical 
approach (Varma et al. 2003, Pokhrel et al. 2004 etc.) and  showed the possibility 
of rainfall over Ocean and land regions. 
Utilizing the frequency and polarization discrimination of passive 
microwave measurements from space, it has been successfully demonstrated that 
satisfactory rainfall retrievals both over land and oceanic areas are feasible. It has 
been seen that satellite estimates based on passive measurements portray the 
rainfall as accurately as radar both in terms of relative intensity and spatial 
distribution. 
 
Rainfall over the oceans are retrieved relatively more reliably than over 
land. In total, the applications that benefited from microwave rainfall estimates 
include weather forecasting (Xiao et al. 2000), climate analysis (Hou et al. 2000), 
and hydrological studies (Petty and Krajwski 1996). The successful use of PM-
based rain estimates in applications from various fields encourages the 
continuation of efforts towards the development of more advanced rain retrieval 
algorithms, despite obvious limitations associated with the low sampling 
frequency of orbiting platforms carrying PM sensors. The recent availability of 
detailed precipitation observations jointly obtained by the first space-borne 
precipitation radar (PR) and a multifrequency passive microwave radiometer, 
TMI, on NASA and NASDA’s TRMM satellite (Simpsion et al. 1996) offers such 
an excellent opportunity for studying such issues. 
Still with such missions dedicated to rainfall estimation, rain retrieval 
algorithms from PM radiometry suffer from various limitations. These limitations 
originate in the multiple hydrometeor profiles that can be associated with a set of 
multifrequency PM measurements (i.e., lack of unique solution The indeterminacy 
is more ever for overland retrievals because of the warm background brightness 
temperatures that limit the use of lower-frequency observations (i.e., 10, 19, and 
22 GHz). Some algorithms, referred to as physically based, are derived using 
radiative transfer calculations through cloud-model simulated fields (Kummerow 
et al. 1996, Haferman et al. 1997). The physically based algorithms were mainly 
investigated in over ocean retrievals. Such physically based retrieval over land are 
few and have not indicated better performance relative to purely statistical 
algorithms (Druen and Heinemann 1998), which are conceptually simpler and 
more practical for applications. 
In the beginning an algorithm for oceanic rainfall was developed   for 
19.35 GHz observations from Nimbus-5 Electrically Scanning Microwave 
Radiometer (ESMR) by Wilheit et al. (1977). Further modification to the 
algorithm was made by using statistical technique for multichannel data in the 
Nimbus-7 Scanning Multichannel  Microwave Radiometer  (SMMR) data 
(Wilheit and Chang 1980). Currently the 85 GHz channel in DMSP-SSM/I (F10, 
F11, F12, F13) and TRMM-TMI offers better possibilities of rainfall estimation. 
The optimal combination of integrated MW and IR observations offers a unique 
opportunity for rainfall retrieval more accurately (Gairola and Krishnamurti 1992, 
Gairola et al. 2005, Jobard and Desbois 1994, Adler et al. 1994, Liu et al. 1995). 
However it requires the rainfall from individual streams (either IR or MW based)

rain algorithms well placed.  In addition to various SSM/I sensors  presently 
available for the rainfall estimation, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission 
(TRMM) provides the best opportunity with all type of passive (MW and VIS/IR) 
and active (MW) sensors onboard as a prelude to the Megha-Tropiques.

MADRAS (Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric 
Structures)  
 
The proposed MADRAS system is a five-channel, self-calibrating, microwave 
radiometer system.  This radiometer is designed to estimate atmospheric water 
parameters in the tropical belt.  The choice of the channels has been driven by 
their potential contribution to the measurement of the parameters defined above, 
from the experience of processing other radiometer data. Table 1 below shows the 
brief description of MADRAS sensor.

2.5.1  Overview: 
Microwave brightness temperatures measured from a satellite-borne radiometer 
results from the integrated effects of surface emission and reflection, absorption 
and emission by atmospheric gases, and absorption, emission and multiple 
scattering of cloud and precipitation particles. Once scattering in the atmosphere 
becomes important (at 85.5 GHz, in particular for cases two and four), the 
influence of the model treatment of multiple scattering overrides the surface 
effect. To accurately describe the microwave signatures, a radiative transfer model 
with full inclusion of the aforementioned effects, particularly the multiple 
scattering by precipitation particles, is required.   
  
The Theory of radiative transfer basically describes the interaction and 
propagation of radiative energy in a medium. As radiation is the most important 
source of energy for driving all the atmospheric processes and also atmospheric 
dynamics is strongly influenced by how solar and the terrestrial radiations are 
scattered, absorbed and emitted by the earth’s surface and the atmosphere. Thus 
the knowledge of radiative transfer is most fundamental in the retrieval of 
atmospheric and earth’s surface parameters in space-borne remote sensing. The 
extensive coverage of radiative transfer formulations has been made by 
Chandrasekhar (1960). 
 
2.5.2 Theoretical Background: 
It is the fundamental integro-differential equation, which governs the variation of 
intensity in a medium characterized by a spectral volumetric absorption 
coefficient, K(s), and a spectral volumetric scattering coefficient, (s), where s 
is the distance along the absorbing path.  
Let us define the spectral volumetric extinction coefficient as

The RTE for Plane-Parallel Atmosphere 
 In plane-parallel atmospheres the medium is stratified in planes 
perpendicular to a given direction z, such that the optical properties of the medium 
are functions of z and  only. Since thickness of a planetary atmosphere is 
generally small compared with its radius, thus this assumption is universally 
applied.

Equation (8) is the basic equation for the problem of radiative transfer in the 
plane-parallel atmosphere, which is extremely difficult to solve. Part of difficulty 
is due to the azimuthal dependence of I through the phase function. By expanding 
Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 
14
the phase function in a Legendre polynomial series, the azimuthally dependent 
terms in the function can be uncoupled. Only the azimuthally independent 
equation contributes to the flux calculations, which is of greatest interest in most 
atmospheric applications. Thus confining our solution for the azimuthally 
independent equation. 
 
Radiative transfer models: 
 
The following two radiative transfer models are being used at SAC for simulations 
and sensitivity studies. 
 
1. Eddington approximations 
                  
In Eddington approximation it is assumed that for an isotropic field the ratio of the 
second moment of the radiation field to the mean intensity is everywhere equal to 
1/3.  
In the plane parallel Eddington approximation, radiances are expanded in a series

following (Fu and Liou, 1992). 
In performing numerical calculations, we divide the atmosphere into many 
layers and assume that all microphysical properties (e.g., particle concentration, 
liquid/ice water content, etc.) are uniform within each layer, but temperature 
varies linearly with optical depth. By solving the Ljs the radiances at quadrature 
angles (i) are obtained.    A boundary condition at the surface allows us to 
calculate the upward radiation at surface given the surface emissivity and 
temperature. Using this analogy of calculating downward radiation from top layer 
to surface, upward radiance can be can continuously calculated from the bottom of 
the layer to the top of the layer  and letting  = 0 until the radiance at the top of the 
layer is solved. The satellite observed radiance at the top of the atmosphere is then 
obtained. Brightness temperature can be calculated from the radiance using 
Plank’s function. Horizontally and Vertically polarized radiances are calculated 
separately because of the difference of their surface emissivity.

Some results of the simulation and sensitivity studies are carried out for different 
frequencies (6.6, 10, 18, 21, 37 and 85 GHz), for various weather conditions that 
include raining and non-raining atmosphere and different sea states. Three 
components of the troposphere are important absorbers. Water vapor, liquid water 
and molecular Oxygen. Frequencies where absorption due to molecular Oxygen is 
important (roughly 50 to 70 GHz and near 119 GHz) are used for temperature 
sounding but are not often used for rainfall sensing. For our purposes, the 
absorption due to molecular Oxygen is a minor correction needed to be 
quantitatively correct but not necessary for conceptual understanding.   
 
2.5.3 Algorithm Description: 
Based on the above brief presentation of the formulation of both emission and 
scattering based radiative transfer, it is highly desirable to create a  data based of 
input and output field vectors for the algorithm development to estimate rainfall 
using the MADRAS frequency channels. However the algorithm is required to be 
derived from radiative transfer calculations through an atmospheric cloud model 
(Tripoli et al.1992, Tao et al. 1993) specifying vertical distributions of ice, 
graupels,  and other liquid hydrometeors as a function of rain rate. Such data base 
from cloud resolving models is very rare and is being explored. In liu of this, the 
algorithm is structured in two main classes. 1. Physically based: based on 
simulated data base as an advanced R & D and 2. Empirically based, based on the 
collocated matched data sets of MADRAS and Ground/Ocean truth data from 
various sources. Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the rain detection from a 
passive microwave sensor. The Flow diagram is given in Fig. 2 (2.1 and 2.2) 
respectively. The complete algorithm steps are mentioned below:  
 
1. Sensitivity studies through simulations of  brightness temperatures for 
MADRAS frequency channels. Till the cloud microphysical data base is 
obtained, the artificially created data base along with ECMWF data will be 
used for radiative transfer simulations following (Liu et al.1998).  
2. To ascertain the sensitivity of different channels to rainfall and other ocean 
and atmospheric variables, to decouple their influence for using in a rain-
rate calculations in particular based on the above data base.  
3. The screening process to distinguish between different land types, raining-
nonraining background conditions associated with the emission and 
scattering characteristics of hydrometeors etc. using multichannel 
brightness temperatures from MADRAS (Following Ferraro et al. 1996 for 
SSM/I). 
4. A matched data base of radiometer brightness temperatures and 
ground/ocaen rainfall from various sources (TRMM-PR, DWR, AWS, RG 
etc.) would be created. Based on the radiative transfer simulations as a 
bench mark, sensitivity studies and screening criterion mentioned above, 
would be applied to the data. 
5. Following the background conditions and emission and scattering 
associated with hydrometeors,  separate algorithms for land and oceans 
Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 
17
will be developed based on the Scattering Index (SI) Method (by Ferraro et 
al. 1996). 
6. Finally the rain rates will be retrieved using SI along with the collocated 
ground/ocean based data following multiple regression and/or Neural 
Network approach.  
7. The resulting rain-rate estimates will be compared to four Doppler 
Weather Radars (DWR) as well as to  buoys and  shipboard measurements 
over a first 6-month period (during calibration/validation phase). 
8. The retrieval algorithm would be attempted for the complete global 
estimates from the MADRAS based on the ground truth data availability 
from various continental and oceanic buoy and ship based sources.  
9. The algorithm will be tested for its accuracy to describe both localized 
instantaneous rainfall events and global rainfall patterns over both land and 
oceans.

2.5.4 The inverse problem: 
 
In the last decade, there has been a growing interest in developing rain profile 
retrieval algorithms trained by cloud radiative databases (Smith et al.1994). This 
Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 
18
approach is based upon the use of radiative transfer models applied to cloud-
resolving hydrometeor profile outputs. The appeal to develop fast inversion 
algorithms using pre-generated physically consistent cloud radiative  databases has 
been largely exploited for spaceborne microwave radiometry of rainfall (Mugnai 
1988 et al. and Kummero et al. 1996). Following this approach, the accuracy of 
rainfall estimates are basically linked to the accuracy of both forward and inverse 
models. In particular, the reliability and consistency of the various radiative transfer 
models, used for building retrieval databases, is a crucial problem to be investigated 
within this framework. As indicated, the simulations will be carried out as a 
reference bench mark for the proper selection of channels and their combinations. 
The real data base would be the collocated matched data base of TBs and ground 
based rainfall measurements.  
Regarding empirical approach, a matched data sets of the MADRAS radiometric 
observations will be attempted in conjunction with the ground based observations 
from rain gauges, Doppler Weather Radars (DWR) etc. There are a couple of 
empirical approaches that could be attempted for the retrievals. These are simple 
multiple regressions between the rainfall and the brightness temperatures from 
MADRAS channels. Other methods are based on the SI, PCT and D approaches 
mentioned above section which are highly applicable for the rainfall retrievals. In 
order to demonstrate the applicability of empirical approaches, the existing data of 
TRMM radar and radiometric observations will be utilized and compared with the 
standard TRMM products of rainfall. The Fig. 3 shows the Logical Flow of 
Algorithm Development and Validation diagram to be used conceptually.

2.5.5   Instantaneous Ocean Rainfall 
  
As is shown earlier that DOM based Radiative transfer calculations represents 
better simulations to determine a brightness temperature, Tb, given a temperature, 
water vapor and hydrometeor profile. An inversion procedure, however, is needed 
to find a rainfall rate, R, given a brightness temperature Tb. The double valued 
nature of the relations is encountered in 19 to 37 GHz channels as is shown in 
sensitivity section; however it could be resolved by a combination of two or more 
channels. Since Tbs are sensitive to the vertical structure of precipitation, the 
vertical structure cannot be ignored when instantaneous retrievals are sought. The 
sensitivity to the assumed profile gets larger as the frequency increases and the 
scattering in the upper layers of the cloud begin to play a larger role. The objective 
of the instantaneous rainfall algorithm over ocean is to be achieved using one of 
the suitable retrieval techniques, such as ANN, MR or Bayesian approach. 
Predefined cloud structures, however, may be utilized to overcome the 
uncertainties in the accuracies of the retrievals. Cloud resolving models such as 
the Goddard Cumulus Ensemble model (GCE), which is a cloud microphysical 
model developed mainly by Tao and Simpson, (1993), or the Tripoli, (1992), 
model are used to supply the required cloud structures. For each cloud model time 
step, radiative transfer computations are supposed to be performed at high 
resolution.  
Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 
20
Databases are generated separately for different freezing heights to capture the 
different 
dynamics of tropical rainfall systems. Once a database of profiles and associated 
brightness temperatures is established, the retrieval employs a straightforward 
inversion methodology. In the absence of a suitable cloud model data base this 
approach will be taken up as a R & D effort.  
Meanwhile, for an alternate operational algorithm development, an equally 
workable approach of the detection of rain over ocean would be employed. 
following For this purpose the data base of TRMM-TMI, and SSM/I radiometric 
TBs will be collocated with TRMM-Precipitation Radar over the global oceans. 
This data base will be used to develop a robust set of relationships with the SSM/I 
sensor (since the frequency channels and footprints of SSM/I are similar to 
MADRAS compared to TRMM-TMI). A matched data base of SSM/I-TBs and 
buoy and ship based rainfall would also be created based on the observations all 
over the tropical oceanic regions. 
Further refinement of the technique is described in Ferraro et al. (1994) and 
Ferraro et al. (1998). The rationale was to first develop a relationship which could 
best predict the 85 GHz Tb under "nonscattering" conditions for the ocean surface 
in question. Then, by estimating this value and subtracting the actual 85 GHz Tb, 
a measure of the depression due to scattering by precipitation ice/rain drops could 
be determined. 
 
 
The form of the Scattering Index method (SI) is as follows: 
With the seven channels of SSM/I, we name E(19V, 21V)85v as the estimated 
value of TB85v by TB19v and TB21v. Based on the data set of rain free areas, we 
will regress a formula E(19v, 21V)85v as follows, which was used to estimate the 
value of TB85v: 
 
E(19V, 21V)85v = a + bTB19v + cTB21v + TB21v2 
 
It has been well established (Yao et al. 2001, Mishra et al. 2007) that when it is 
not raining, E(19V, 21V)85v can represent well the value of TB85v. The Scatering 
Index over the ocean thus can be defined as the difference between E(19V, 
21V)85v (the estimated value of TB85v) and TB85v (the observed value of TB85v): 
 
SIO = E(19V, 21V)85v –TB85v  
 
SIO = a + bTb19v + cTb21v + d Tb21222v – Tb85v 
 
 where the coefficients a,b,c, and d were derived by assembling a global data set 
of SSM/I observations under scatter-free conditions. Through an exhaustive 
evaluation, it could be found that a threshold SI value could be a good, global 
indicator of rain. A lower threshold does detect more rain; however, it also causes 
the detection of false alarms to increase. Because snow and deserts can cause a 
similar scattering signature, a set of "screens" would be developed to remove such 
features based on the screening approach of Ferraro et al. 1996. . The desert check 
involves the use of polarization information at 19 GHz, while the separation of 
rain from snow utilizes two relationships involving the Tb at 22 and 85 GHz.  
Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 
21
Specifically, the following type of relationship would be attempted based on PR 
rain rate and SSM/I based SIO   to work best for tropical Indian Ocean and  global 
oceanic regions. 
 
RR mm/hr . = a SIOb 
 
This method to retrieve rain rate would be compared with the standard products of 
rainfall from SSM/I and TRMM. TRMM provides various data sets on rain rates 
over both land and oceans in the form of surface rain rate, total rain in 3 hourly 
etc. Similarly SSM/I provides oceanic rain rates  on instantaneous and 
accumulation on daily basis. 
 
2.5.6. Instantaneous Land Rainfall 
 
Over land, rainfall retrievals are far more complex and difficult than oceanic 
retrievals due to the large and variable emissivity of the land surface. Specifically, 
the high emissivity masks the emission signature that is related directly to the 
water content in the atmosphere. Instead, only the brightness temperature 
depression due to scattering in the upper portion of clouds is observed. The 
scattering, as shown in Figure 3, increases with increasing frequencies. 
Consequently, brightness temperature depressions at the 89 GHz channel of 
MADRAS will contain the least ambiguous signal of scattering by ice and/or large 
raindrops. The brightness temperature depression will be converted to an expected 
rainfall rate through the retrieval scheme where databases of hydrometeor profiles 
(associated with a variety of rain systems) will be developed for different 
climatological zones. Recent results from TRMM indicate that the relationship of 
lightning flashes (which is highly correlated with the 85 GHz scattering signature) 
and rainfall varies over the global land regions. Development of profile databases 
for different climatological zones can account for regional differences. However, 
as a starting point, we will insure that these retrievals match closely with 
established algorithms developed for the SSM/I and TMI sensors. 
  
A further complication that arises over land is the lack of consistent backgrounds 
against 
which to compare the Tb depression. To alleviate this problem caused by the 
varying emissivity associated with changes in surface characteristics (e.g., surface 
wetness, snow 
cover, vegetation, etc.), a rain/no-rain temperature depression threshold is 
required. The “screening” issue has always been one of modest controversy in the 
land-based retrievals because of the empirical nature of their form. Intuitively, one 
immediately thinks that such screens will vary greatly with sensor. However, as is 
described later, these screens (i.e., Tb relationships separating rainfall from other 
surfaces) seem to hold valid for other sensors, with only minor modifications 
needed. Additionally, one school of thought in physical retrievals is that the rain 
rate retrieval becomes a two-step process: rain identification and rain rate 
determination.  
The basis for the retrieval over land comes from the work of Grody (1991), who 
developed a global scattering index (SI) at 85 GHz for use with the SSM/I sensor. 
Further refinement of the technique is described in Ferraro et al. (1994) and 
Ferraro et al. (1998). The rationale was to first develop a relationship which could 
Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 
22
best predict the 85 GHz Tb under "nonscattering" conditions for the land surface 
in question. Then, by estimating this value and subtracting the actual 85 GHz Tb, 
a measure of the depression due to scattering by precipitation ice/rain drops could 
be determined. The form of the SI is as follows: 
 
SI85v = a + bTb19v + cTb21v + d Tb21222v – Tb85v 
 
 where the coefficients a,b,c, and d were derived by assembling a global data set 
of SSM/I observations under scatter-free conditions. Through an exhaustive 
evaluation, Grody (1991) found that an SI value of 10 K or greater was a good, 
global indicator of rain. A lower threshold does detect more rain; however, it also 
causes the detection of false alarms to increase. Because snow and deserts can 
cause a similar scattering signature, a set of "screens" were developed to remove 
such features. The desert check involves the use of polarization information at 19 
GHz, while the separation of rain from snow utilizes two relationships involving 
the Tb at 22 and 85 GHz. 
Ferraro et al., (1994), built upon the Grody (1991) study, and developed a more 
robust set 
of relationships to be used for the detection of rain over land from the SSM/I. In 
this study, separate relationships were developed for land and ocean, improving 
the sensitivity to scattering. In addition, the original relationships derived by 
Grody (1991) used antenna temperatures which were convolved to the 19 GHz 
FOV; the updated study used the more conventional Tb values and preserved the 
original SSM/I footprint sizes, allowing for easy implementation by the scientific 
community. An alternative method to retrieve rain rate has been to calibrate the SI 
with ground-based radar measurements from the United States, Japan, and the 
United Kingdom (Ferraro and Marks, 1995). Similar to the oceans, the following 
relationship would be attempted to work best for global oceans: 
 
RR mm/hr . = a SIL
 
where RR is in mm/hr. Since these relationships increase rapidly for higher values 
of SIL, 
any retrieval above 35 mm/hr is set to 35 mm/hr. Although somewhat arbitrary, 
practice 
shows that this is the upward limit of rain rates retrievable from the 85 GHz 
measurements (e.g., the maximum mean rain rate that could exist in a 13 by 15 km 
FOV). Using the 10K minimum threshold for the SIL values, the minimum 
retrievable rain rate is approximately 0.5 mm/hr. This algorithm was implemented 
by FNMOC in 1995 as the operational SSM/I rain rate algorithm, and continues to 
operate in that capacity. In addition, the monthly derived rainfall from this 
algorithm (Ferraro, 1997) is used as a component of the GPCP blended analysis 
(Huffman et al., 1996)The MADRAS instrument will contain nearly similar 
frequencies to the SSM/I. Initially the SSM/I based coefficients will be used and 
later fine tuned for MADRAS, based on a large data base to be co-located during 
raining episodes.

2.8 Validation   
Extensive validation campaign is required during the first six months of the 
satellite launch.  To compare retrieved rainfall totals with rainfall totals obtained 
by other satellites like TRMM and SSM/I will be attempted. Some more direct 
means, often called "Ground Truth", may also be attempted based on the avialility 
of well calibrated data from AWS and DWR’s. The initial six months will be the 
calibration-validation phase with limited distribution of data. The validation is 
possible with: 
 
1. Other satellite data sets from regional and global sources (land & 
ocean). 
2. Rainfall data from well calibrated DWR data from Indian 
Meteorological Department 
 
The traditional approach has been to take a 2 dimensional rain field derived from 
radar measurements, assume it is constant in the third dimension and use the 
resultant pseudo 3 dimensional rain field for the simulation. This initial averaging 
step reduces the variability of the rain field and thereby reduces both the value and 
uncertainty of the BFC.

The level 1a and level 1b products are required for above-mentioned approaches for 
the rainfall retrievals. The database created in an offline process will act as a tool 
for the algorithm development. During the initial six months of calibration-
validation phase the knowledge of the noise characteristics of the different 
horizontal and vertical polarization channels will be applied for the improvement of 
the algorithm. This period will also help in creating a database of ground-based 
networks like rain gages, Automatic Weather Stations and Doppler Weather Radars 
in consistency with the MADRAS observations for the empirical algorithm 
development. The satellite overpasses in and around DWR and rain gauge sites will 
be utilized for the validation purposes. One complete iteration of TRMM rainfall 
validation campaign was exercised using the SHAR and IMD DWR at Chennai 
(Gairola et al. 2004) in a compaign mode. TRMM radar and radiometric 
observations of rainfall were compared with DWR on various grid scales. This 
needs to be augmented during the Megha-Tropiques time frame using all the five 
DWRs in the country, AWS and the fast response rain gauges. The error statistics 
will be generated with a possible feedback mechanism to correct for some biases 
etc. to make the algorithm more robust. 
 
2.9 Technical Issues 
For the instantaneous rainfall error there are some major sources of error: 
 
1) Availability of Cloud resolving model simulations 
2) Coastal boundaries.  
3) Beam Filling Error 
4) Vertical distribution of Hydrometeors 
5) The freezing level retrieval 
 
These error sources are very critical and needs to be followed with active groups 
working at various places elsewhere (in country or abroad). 
 
2.10 Future Scope: 
In the present document the possibilities of both physical and empirical algorithms 
for rainfall retrieval are highlighted. However due to certain limitations the 
empirical algorithm has been emphasized as an operational one. It would be based 
on the radiatiatve transfer simulations as the pointers to optimize the frequency 
channels. This is also important in view of the different noise scenario of the 
different channels to be known only after the launch of the satellite. Based on the 
performance of the algorithm over global tropical ocean and land, the fine tuning 
will be carried out. The ongoing advanced research on radiative transfer based 
algorithm will be worked out in future to generate the data base for retrievals. 
However, in any case an algorithm would be in place for its global applicability at 
par with the algorithms elsewhere for different satellite sensors like TRMM, 
SSM/I and GPM.

 Introduction: 
With the advent of well-calibrated satellite microwave radiometers, it is now 
possible to obtain long time series of geophysical parameters that are important 
for studying various atmospheric and oceanic processes. In order to strengthen the 
observation base to provide impetus to the studies concerning tropical processes, 
India and France have jointly proposed the Megha-Tropiques (MT) mission. In 
addition to a radiation budget instrument (SCAnner for RAdiative Budget: 
SCRAB), an atmospheric sounding instrument (SAPHIR), and a GPS receiver for 
occultation based profile measurements, the MT mission will also be carrying a 
microwave radiometer that designed specifically to measure rainfall and cloud/sea 
ice, and also the cloud liquid water, wind speed and water vapor over the global 
oceans.  This radiometer is referred as MADRAS (Measurement and Detection of 
rain and Atmospheric Systems). 
Microwave remote sensing program in ISRO started with the launch of its first 
microwave radiometer SAMIR-I onboard Bhaskara-I satellite in 1979 followed by 
similar payload SAMIR-II launched onboard Bhaskara-2 satellite in 1981. After a 
gap of nearly two decades, India launched microwave radiometer MSMR onboard 
Oceansat-1 (IRS-P4) satellite in May 1999. The MSMR provided the measured 
the measurements of radiances at 6.6, 10, 19 and 22 GHz channels.  Gohil (1999) 
and Gohil et al. (2000a, 2000b) provided the description of the retrieval 
Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 
30
algorithms for geophysical parameters like integrated water vapor (IWV), cloud 
liquid water (CLW), wind speed (WS) and sea surface temperature (SST) from the 
MSMR. Apart from these parameters MSMR was also exploited for rain 
measurements (Varma et al., 2002a, Varma et al., 2003, Pokhrel et al., 2003, 
Gairola et al, 2004)) even in the severe weather conditions like cyclone (Varma et 
al., 2006). The MSMR derived geophysical parameters were found to be in good 
agreement with ground and the other satellite observations (Varma et al., 2002b). 
 
3.3  Overview and Background 
This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) focuses on the MADRAS 
microwave radiometer that is scheduled to fly in 2008/2009 on the MT mission. 
MADRAS will measure the Earth’s radiation over the spectral range from 19 to 
157 GHz. over the entire globe within tropics. The channel details and expected 
accuracies are given in the Table 1 (Desbois, 1999). For convenience, we will 
refer 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, 89 and 157 GHz frequencies as 19, 24, 37, 89 and 157 GHz, 
respectively.  It will be possible to retrieve the three important geophysical 
parameters, IWV, WS and CLW. Rainfall can also be retrieved, which is 
discussed in a separate MT ATBD. The parameters are to be retrieved under the 
non-raining situations because at the microwave frequencies used for retrieval of 
the above parameters the emission due to rain is very strong and than obscure the 
effect of the other parameters. The table-2 provides the radiative transfer model 
calculated change in the brightness temperatures at 19, 21 and 37 GHz frequencies 
due to 1 mm h-1 of rain rate. It may be noted that a low raining condition of rain 
rate 1 mm h-1, can even change the brightness temperature significantly.

The sensitivity of the geophysical parameters to observing frequency is studied  
by Wilheit and Chang (1980). The study indicates high sensitivity for SST only at 
frequencies < 10 GHz. Hence the SST retrieval from MADRAS is not included in 
this document. The wind has high senstivity at 19 and 37 GHz channels but these 
channels are also affected by water vapor and cloud liquid water in the 
atmosphere. Gohil et al. (2000a) have shown that inclusion of lower frequency 
channels (6 GHz) in the wind retrieval algorithm improves the accuracy. This is 
mainly due to less influence of the water vapor and cloud liquid water on the 
lower frequency channels. Due to the absence of 10 and 6 GHz channels on 
MADRAS, wind retrieval accuracy will be slightly poorer compared to MSMR or 
TMI. The rms accuracies given in Table 3 come from SSM/I experience. We are 
hopeful that the retrieval accuracies for IWV, WS, and CLW will be almost 
similar to that available from SSM/I due to nearly identical lower frequency 
channels which are used for retrieval of the parameters being discussed in this 
document. However, the radiometer noise is crucial to achieve this accuracy.

Radiative Transfer Model 
The brightness temperature received by microwave radiometer looking towards 
earth in non-scattering atmosphere in a thermodynamic equilibrium is given by:  
 
Tb(,p) = TbDN () (1-(Ts, ,p)) +Ts (Ts, ,p) ()+TbUP 
 
Where, Tbν = brightness temperature measured at frequency ν 
 
TbDN = downwelling radiances 
 
TbUP = upwelling radiances 
 
= frequency of observation 
 
 = angle of incidence 
 
 = transmittance

The total brightness temperature has three components as mentioned in expression 
above and also in Fig. 1. First, the emitted radiation by the atmosphere directly 
reaching to the radiometer which mainly depends upon the absorption by 
atmospheric constituents like dominantly absorbing gases (oxygen and water 
Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 
34
vapor) and the hydrometeors (water drops of cloud and rain). Second, the 
atmospheric radiation reaching the earth surface and gets reflected by it and 
reaches to the radiometer after having attenuated by the intervening atmosphere. 
Third, the radiation emitted by the earth surface after attenuated by the intervening 
atmosphere reaches to the radiometer. Thus, the total radiation received by the 
radiometer is affected by both atmosphere and earth surface. 
 
We propose to use the standard stat-of-art radiative transfer models from Florida 
State University (Liu, 1998).  In Liu’s model the absorption models by 
Rosenkranz (1998) for oxygen and Rosenkranz (1993) for water vapour are used. 
Absorption due to non precipitating cloud is calculated using the model given by 
(Paris, 1971). The clouds will be simulated as given in the next paragraph. Liu’s 
model (1992) utilizes Guillon et al. (1998) for calculating the ocean surface 
emissivity. The brightness temperatures thus simulated from the known 
atmospheric and surface geophysical variables are used to establish suitable 
statistical or physiostatistical relationships between them and atmpsheric 
parameters for retrieval purpose. 
 
Masking the rainy area 
A radiative transfer based method for rain identification over global oceans is 
developed prior the launch of the Megha-Tropiques satellite to avoid the retrieval 
of other GPs over oceans. The scheme is based on developing step-by-step 
procedures for transforming MADRAS based scattering index (SI) to equivalent 
SSM/I based scattering index with high accuracy (Varma et al., 2011).   
 
Ferraro and Mark (1995) and Ferraro et al. (1996) provided a rain identification 
and retrieval algorithm over land and oceans. Their algorithm is based on 
empirical relationship between rain rate and scattering index which is originally 
proposed by Grody (1991). The Ferraro and Mark (1995) algorithm is developed 
for SSM/I channels and is not directly portable to MADRAS which is having 
different sensor characteristics. According to Grody (1991), scattering index (SI) 
is defined as depression in the SSM/I 85 GHz V polarized Tb (Tb85V) due to 
scattering in the presence of rain. They calculated the depression by taking the 
difference between observed rain-affected Tb85V and its expected value (Fs) 
Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 
35
under rain free conditions. The expected Tb85V (Fs) under rain free conditions is 
worked out by establishing a relationship between SSM/I Tbs at 85.5 GHz V and 
at 19.35 GHz V & H and 22.23 GHz V channels that are essentially emission 
channels and are considered not to be affected by scattering. The relationship that 
they proposed for scattering index (SI) is as follows: 
 
SI = Fs – TbiV,                   
 
where, TbiV is Tb from high frequency 85.5 GHz V polarized SSM/I channel, and 
Fs is expected TbiV under rain free conditions. The Fs is defined as,  
Fs= a1*Tb1+a2*Tb2+a3*Tb3+a0    
 
These coefficients for SSM/I and MADRAS are calculated using radiative transfer 
simulated database of brightness temperatures under raining and non-raining 
conditions.  This is shown schematically in Fig. 2 below.  
 
 
 
Fig. 2: Scheme for simulation of brightness temperatures for SSM/I and 
MADRAS using NCEP environment fields and finding regression relation 
for expected brightness temperature at 85.5 GHz (SSM/I) / 89 GHz 
(MADRAS).  
 
In the next step a regression based relationship is established between SI (SSM/I) 
and SI (MADRAS). This relationship is used to estimate expected SI (SSM/I) for 
given SI (MADRAS). According to Ferraro and Mark (1995) and Ferraro et al. 
(1996), rain is expected when SI > 10. We use the same value of SI for identifying 
rain event.

The high amount of CLW affects less to TPW retrieval but more to WS retrieval 
for WS being a surface parameter (Wentz, 1997). We therefore restrict the CLW 
value for the retrieval of the TPW and WS to 50 mg cm-2 and 18 mg cm-2, 
respectively (Wentz, 1997). Thus if CLW exceeds these thresholds values, the 
TPW and WS are not retrieved. 
 
Inversion Techniques: 
Inversion techniques that are proposed to be employed have their heritage from 
MSMR, are essentially statistical techniques in which relationships between the 
predictors and the predictants are established. A general inversion technique is 
mathematically represented by the following expression: 


Tb
D
G

*

 
Here, G is a vector whose elements are various geophysical parameters which is 
related to a measurement basis function vector φ(Tb) of simulated brightness 
temperatures Tb by a matrix D. The measurement basis function vector contains 
the elements which could either be pure or functions of TB. The matrix D is given 
by: 


where C is a correlation matrix and is obtained from geophysical variables' 
statistics.  
Separate inversion coefficients are established for each geophysical variable. 
Different combinations of channels and polarization are required for different 
variable as the dependence of brightness temperature on these variables is 
different. Sensitivity studies and effect of errors in measurements on retrieval is 
also required for finalization of suitable combinations. 
 
Effect of Sensor-Satellite System errors on retrievals: 
As seen above that the retrieval coefficient matrix D is dependent on geophysical 
parameters as well as on the corresponding simulated brightness temperatures, the 
matrix D is affected by chosen statistics of geophysical parameters and on various 
errors in the brightness temperatures typical of a particular radiometer system and 
satellite attitude. It is always better for a stable retrieval to include the wide 
statistics of geophysical parameters and to account for various errors in the 
measurements of brightness temperatures by a radiometer and satellite attitude. 
Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 
37
The dominant errors in the brightness temperature measurements are the system 
noise at antenna and radiometer system, calibration, uncertainties in knowing the 
actual measurement geometry (viz. incidence angle and polarization etc). Thus 
knowledge of total error in measurements is must for establishing the retrieval 
matrix which enables to provide better estimates of geophysical parameters with 
known errors as far as possible. The point to be noted here is that the retrieval will 
have errors in geophysical estimates from the erroneous data; however, the errors 
will be still more if we underestimate the overall error in brightness temperature 
and use such retrieval matrix D with actual data having even higher errors. On the
 
other hand, the errors will also be more in parameters retrieved with matrix 
D established using overestimated errors and using it with less erroneous data. 
Therefore, it is must to know the true behavior of radiometer, system in terms of 
total error in brightness temperatures and the biases in the measurements. The 
next step is to fine-tune the retrieval matrix using the insitu data widely spread 
over space and time. Moreover, the theoretical errors (mostly of non-random 
nature) due to radiative transfer model are taken care by fine tuning of retrieval 
matrix through validation data.

Post-Launch Scenario  
After MT-MADRAS is launched and the collocated in situ data are available, we 
will calibrate the pre-launch algorithm by making small adjustments to the 
coefficients of the retrieval algorithms presented in section 3.5. This will be 
carried out based on validation results.

3.8 Validation 
A separate ATBD for validation is submitted. However, the limited validation (in 
collaboration with validation team) for fine tuning of the retrieval algorithm will 
be carried out and the details of which are presented below.  
3.8.1 Data required 
 Measurement of GPs from other satellites 
 Surface insitu measurements over global oceans. 
3.8.2 Method of validation 
 
 Collocated pointwise comparison statistics to be generated. 
 Histogram of GPs over given area and season to be compared. 
 Variability and Trends to be studied. 
3.9 Technical issues: 
In this document we have provided the details of the various components of the 
retrieval algorithm for deriving the cloud liquid water, wind speed and integrated 
water vapor over oceans using MT-MADRAS channels. We hope to achieve the 
accuracies as provided for SSM/I. In view of our past experience of deriving the 
same parameters using MSMR observation, we do not foresee any practical 
difficulty in deriving the same using MT-MADRAS. The derived parameters need 
Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 
40
to be validated   extensively over different regions and seasons of the year so that 
complete dynamic range of the parameters could be validated. We expect a 
separate team will be looking for the validation aspect. We, however, need their 
feedback for fine tuning the retrieval algorithms in the post launch phase. 
3.10 Future Scope 
Retrieval algorithms have to be validated and then if necessary fine tuning of the 
algorithms have to be carried out.  This will be done by adjusting the coefficients 
in the D-matrix by minimizing the errors between observations and the 
estimations.

Introduction 
The Megha-Tropiques (MT) satellite is designed to study the impact of water 
cycle on atmospheric climate processes and energy exchanges over the Tropics.  
Megha-Tropiques was launched into a circular 867-kilometer orbit inclined at 20 
degrees to the equatorial plane on 12th October 2011. From this orbit; the satellite 
is able to collect frequent data over the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone to 
complement and augment those obtained by satellites in geostationary and polar 
orbits. The MT satellite payloads are high-technology sensors viz. Microwave 
Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric Structures (MADRAS), a 
millimeter wave humidity profiler (SAPHIR), an optical-IR radiometer for 
radiation budget (ScaRAB) and a radio occultation sensor (GPS-ROS). All the 
sensors have been integrated with IRS platform and primarily developed under 
ISRO-CNES joint collaboration. 
4.2.1 Overview and background: 
The Sondeur Atmosphérique du Profil d'Humidité Intertropicale par Radiométrie 
(SAPHIR) instrument is developed by IPSL and Observatoire de Paris as part of 
the MEGHA-TROPIQUES payload to study the vertical distribution of water 
vapour in the tropical troposphere, with two specific objectives: 
 
1. Analysis of the diurnal cycle of the water vapour distribution, to evaluate the 
vertical   transports associated with convective structures at the mesoscale and the 
large scale, and to understand the scale-to-scale interactions in the meridional flux 
2. Study of the role of the space-time distribution of humidity on the development 
of deep convection. 
 
An additional aim is to improve parameterizations of humidity related processes 
in AGCM. The need for such an instrument on the Megha Tropiques platform was 
driven by the following main reasons: 
 
Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 
45
a) Scarcity of accurate and frequent water vapour profile measurements in tropical      
latitudes for studying convective system life cycle. 
b) Existing and other future sounders are planned to be onboard polar orbiting 
satellites   leading to heterogeneous data. 
4.2.2 Objectives 
 
 To retrieve humidity profile in 6 layers of the atmosphere from 
1000 to 100 mb. 
 To validate the retrieved profiles with concurrent radiosonde, 
satellites observations and NWP model fields. 
 To improve the retrievals based on the validation feedback.

4.5.1 Basic principle 
The scientific objective of SAPHIR calls for determination of humidity with an 
accuracy of 10 to 20% in 6 layers of the troposphere with 10 km of spatial 
resolution.  For realizing that goal, it is necessary to choose channels for which the 
atmospheric contribution to the radiance comes from different levels of the 
troposphere.  This can be obtained by sampling an absorption line of water vapour 
by channels more or less close to the centre of the line.  A candidate line, already 
chosen for other instruments, is the line at 183.3 GHz.  It is possible to get 
contribution functions peaking from heights of 2 km up to 12 km in tropical 
atmospheres.  However, the width of the contribution functions makes it 
redundant to use more than 5 channels.  A sixth complementary channel, in a 
window region, has to be used to correct for the surface effects in the lower 
channels. 
The SAPHIR humidity sounder operates at six channels around 183.31 GHz 
designated as S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6. given in Table-1.The final selection of 
layers is carried out by first building a learning data base, consisting of 
meteorological profiles, and brightness temperatures simulated by running a 
radiative transfer model on the profiles; then a multiple regression  inversion 
scheme is applied to retrieve the humidity in each layer.

Where ,  are atmospheric absorption and transmittance, respectively, Ts,  are 
sea surface temperature and emissivity, , , p are incidence angle, frequency of 
SAPHIR channel and polarization. Tbup, TBdn are upwelling and down-welling 
atmospheric brightness temperatures. The models used are those of Liebe (1993) 
for atmospheric absorption, Hollinger (1973) for calm, Stogryn (1972) for wind 
roughened and Wilheit (1979) for foam covered sea surface emissivity, 
respectively. Low frequency wing of SAPHIR channels have been considered for 
the simulations of brightness temperatures. 
For the microwave frequencies in the resonance region of dominant absorbers like 
water vapour and oxygen, the transmittance is very low or negligible so that the 
contribution to the total radiation to the radiometer by reflected down-welling and 
surface radiations becomes negligible. Therefore, the total brightness temperature 
is expressed as 
 
                                         (6) 
 
The product of absorption due to a thin atmospheric layer and the transmittance of 
the overlying atmosphere is known as the weighting function as given below 
 
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                           (7) 
 
with  
 
 
The profile of weighting function with altitude is characterized by the absorption 
profile for a specific frequency. The weighting function profile has a peak at a 
particular altitude for a particular frequency in resonance region. This implies the 
maximum sensitivity of a channel at the peak altitude of weighting function. This 
forms the basis for the sounding of the atmosphere at various altitudes using 
different channels in the resonance region. On the other hand, the radiation 
received by the radiometer is the weighted contribution by different layers of the 
atmosphere with maximum contributions from the layers having peak weighting 
function. The peak of the weighting function shifts towards higher altitude as the 
channel frequency nears the resonance line of an absorber. Contrary to it, the peak 
of weighting function shifts towards surface for transparent or window channels 
and the atmospheric contributions also reduce to greater extents. The window 
channels are used for surface sensing.

4.5.1.2 Retrieval techniques: 
The sensitivity of simulated brightness temperatures on humidity has been studied 
under varying atmospheric conditions. This experiment is useful in selecting the 
atmospheric thick-overlapping layers (TOL) influencing maximum number of 
channels to be considered for better retrievals. Additionally, these TOL  are also 
innovatively utilized to derive humidity for thin-isolated layers (TIL) which 
otherwise will have large retrieval errors when directly derived from the channel 
brightness temperatures (due to broad overlapping nature of channel’s Weighting 
Functions (WFs) as shown in Figure 1b). Retrieval has been performed for the 7 
TOL’s lying between the pressure values (1000-550) mb, (1000-400) mb, (850-
400) mb, (850-250) mb, (700-250) mb, (700-100) mb and (550-100) mb 
respectively on the basis of their sensitivity with SAPHIR chennels’ brightness 
tempratures. From these seven TOL’s, the LARH for six TIL’s lying between 
pressure values (1000-850) mb, (850-700) mb, (700-550) mb, (550-400) mb, 
(400-250) mb, and (250-100) mb have been derived. 
 
Definitions of the TOL and TIL are given below. 
 
The layer-average relative humidity (LARH) for TOL is the relative humidity 
(RH) averaged with respect to logarithm of pressure over a layer between two 
pressure limits “p1” and “p2” as defined below  
 
                 (8) 
 
As mentioned above, thin-isolated layers (TILs) have also been derived from two 
Thick-overlapping layers (TOLs) as follows. From known LARH values for two 
TOLs with pressure levels “p1” to “p3” and “p2” to “p3”, the LARH value for a 
TIL with pressure levels “p1” to “p2” can be derived as

The LARH for TIL between “p1” to “p2” is derived using expressions (9b and 9c)

The relationship between brightness temperature and TOL for SAPHIR channels 
is established as given as 
 
                              (10) 
 
Where TOL is the layer averaged relative humidity in percent, A0,p is the retrieval 
constant for pth layer, A1i,p  and A2i,p are retrieval coefficient for ith channel, TBi is 
brightness temperatures of ith SAPHIR channel with six channels. The coefficients 
have been established using the simulated BT from the simulated clear sky 
atmospheres mentioned above. The noise in all BT’s has been introduced as per 
the noise characteristics of SAPHIR instrument.  
 
TIL are derived from TOL from the following relationship 
 
                                                                           (11) 
 
Where, these TOL’s are those having the desired TIL as their difference.

Validation 
Validation of the derived humidity profiles will be done using all the available 
data from radiosonde, special cruises over oceans and available similar products 
from various satellite missions. 
4.8.1   Data required: 
Radiosonde and ship data for validation should consists of following parameter 
 Station/Ship ID 
 Location of the measurement 
 Time of the measurement 
 Relative humidity in %  
 Height/pressure at which measurement is taken 
 Air Temperature at the same height 
Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 
52
 Instrument accuracy of humidity. 
 
4.8.2   Methods of validation 
From the observed profiles of humidity for clear sky conditions, brightness 
temperatures corresponding to SAPHIR channels will be computed with the help 
of  radiative transfer model used in the retrieval algorithm. The computed 
brightness temperatures are analysed with SAPHIR-observed brightness 
temperatures to estimate the bias (slope and intercept of the linear regression 
equation) for each of the sounder channels. These bias-corrections will be 
implemented in the regression retrieval routines to remove the bias between 
sounder observations and the radiative transfer model computations. 
4.9 
Future scope: 
The present study does not include the sensitivity of SAPHIR channels to land 
emissivity variations and clouds. Inclusion of such cases will definitely improve 
the quality of humidity profiles. In order to minimize the surface contribution in 
the lower frequency SAPHIR channels inclusion of 150 GHz brightness 
temperature from MADRAS is also desirable that will be taken up in future..

Introduction 
An understanding of the radiation budget of the earth is fundamental because the 
weather/climate system is a heat engine, with absorbed solar radiation being the 
energy source and Earth-emitted radiation being the energy sink necessary to 
drive the system. Earth Radiation Budget studies are of paramount importance in 
the context of global climate change. The delicate balance of the incoming and the 
outgoing radiation, which is being disturbed by anthropogenic activities, mark 
their signatures in the top of atmosphere radiation budget quantities. Top of 
atmosphere radiation budget quantities can be estimated from satellites using well-
calibrated broadband radiometers.  
 
Scanner for Radiation Budget (ScaRaB) onboard Megha-Tropiques is a 4-channel 
cross-track scanning radiometer. The four channels include two broad spectral 
bands (Channel-2 and Channel-3) from which the reflected shortwave and emitted 
longwave radiances are derived and two narrow bands (Channel-1 and Channel-4) 
one corresponding to the infrared atmospheric window, other to the visible (green 
to red) portion of the solar spectrum (Table.1). Purpose of keeping the two narrow 
band channels are: (i) R&D activities and (ii) estimate the errors associated with 
the narrow band to broad band extrapolations.

Satellite measurement of the earth–atmosphere radiations are usually confined to 
certain local times and specific directions of view depending on orbital constraints 
Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0

and instrument scanning capabilities. Due to the smaller spatial view of the 
ScaRaB, only limited angular coverage is possible by each observation. In the 
case of ScaRaB, the direct measurement is radiance while the desired 
measurement is radiative flux at the top of atmosphere.  Derivation of the radiative 
flux using the ScaRaB radiance observations then requires the use of measured 
satellite radiances and assumptions about the anisotropy of the earth’s radiation 
field. The primary modification of the earth’s anisotropy is caused by the 
variations in cloud properties. In this document details about the ScaRaB/Megha-
Tropiques data processing system that can compute top of atmosphere shortwave 
(SW) and Longwave (LW) fluxes from measured radiances is described. 
 
5.2.1 Overview and Background: 
The ScaRaB/Megha-Tropiques data processing system corresponds to the ERBE-
like data processing system, already used and assessed by the former ERBE, 
ScaRaB and CERES experiments. In this system, the ‘maximum likelihood 
estimation’ algorithm (Wielicki and Green, 1989) is used for scene identification. 
The 12-scene classification is based on five geo-types [ocean, land, snow-ice, 
desert and coast] and four cloud types [clear, partly cloudy, mostly cloudy and 
overcast]. The raw radiances are first corrected for spectral filtering effects as a 
function of identified scene. Next scene-type dependent angular correction models 
(anisotropic factor from Suttles et al, 1988; 1989) are used to deduce the SW and 
LW fluxes of the pixel as a function of measured radiances. 
 
 
Three important steps involved in the ScaRaB radiance to flux computation are: 
 
1. Spectral correction 
 
2. Scene Identification and 
3. Flux computation (by applying scene-type dependent ADM). 
 
5.2.1.1 Spectral Correction 
The calibrations of the filtered radiances LTf  and LSWf    are normalized to precise 
radiation sources: blackbodies at temperature respectively 310 K and 5800 K. 
Then the unfiltered radiances are equal to filtered radiances only if the observed 
targets have similar or proportional emission spectra.   Otherwise the unfiltered 
radiances are calculated from the filtered radiances

where Fscene is the filtering factor, varying around 1 according to the spectral shape 
or colour of the scene.  
5.2.1.2 Scene Identification 
Unlike the CERES instrument on TRMM, Aqua and Terra missions, the 
ScaRaB/MeghaTropiques will not have an imager payload for scene 
identification. To identify the scene, the indirect ERBE scene identification 
method (Wieliecki et al., 1989) will be utilized.  This is a statistical approach 
Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 
57
called Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) technique and uses only the 
unfiltered LLW and LSW radiances measured by ScaRaB for scene identification. 
 
 
5.2.1.2.1 ERBE Angular Model 
Both the scene identification and the flux computation use the ERBE Angular 
Dependence Model (ADM) generated by Suttles et al. (1989). From statistical 
analysis of  satellite measurement (mainly seven months of Nimbus 7 radiance 
measurements), the radiance anisotropy is described for 12 scene types, 
combination of 5 geo-types and 4 cloud cover categories (Table 2). In the LW, the 
ADM depends on latitude and season. The ADM are not continuous functions of 
the angles, but discrete values corresponding to the angular intervals.

In the following, subscript Mod stands for Modelled (ADM). 
R is the LW anisotropy function 
  is the SW anisotropic function (bidirectional reflection) 
 
The LW ADM contains: 
1. Flux Mmod (Iscn, Colat) 
2. Anisotropy function R (Iscn, ’, Colat) 
3. Standard-deviation of radiances in the corresponding angular bin  (Iscn, 
’, Colat) 
 
The SW ADM contains: 
1. Albedo amod (Iscn, ’) 
2. SW anisotropy function  (Iscn, ’, ’, ’) 
3. Standard-deviation of radiances    (Iscn, ’, ’, ’)

’  
= view zenith angle (VZA) 
 
’

Instead of using amod  it is practical to define the angular dependence of the 
albedo: 
   
 (Iscn, ’) = amod (Iscn, ’)/ amod (Iscn, ’=0) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Where the denominator is the ‘overhead’ albedo or albedo for sun at zenith 
 
5.2.1.2.2 Maximum Likelihood Estimator 
From the ADM tables, the modelled radiances with their associated standard 
deviations can be easily calculated for the four cloud categories. In the LW/SW 
graph (Figure-1), the centre of the ellipse represents the average SW-LW 
radiances and the areas describe the standard deviation. The cloud fraction of a 
measurement is determined by its location on this plane. For each ScaRaB 
measured SW-LW pair, probabilities for being each case are calculated. The 
highest probability identifies the cloud fraction.

5.2.1.3 LW Scene Identification 
This scene identification is done for night-time. The algorithm proceeds with the 
following steps: 
 
Step-1 Search the geographic information Ngeo 
From latitude and longitude, the following variables are searched: 
Ngeo  :  Geo-type (ocean, land, desert, snow-ice, coast)  
Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 
59
Mgeo :  Outgoing clear sky flux (Wm-2) 
 
For the earlier ScaRaB missions, the geo-type map was updated each month to 
take into account the variation of snow at high latitudes. For Megha-Tropiques 
such an update may be not necessary due to the negligible snow cover variation in 
the 30 tropical coverage belt. 
The Mgeo dataset is also defined on monthly basis. Then the Mgeo corresponding to 
land and desert regions are corrected for diurnal variations. 
 
Step-2 Compute the theoretical outgoing flux M from Mgeo and ADM   
For each cloud category ( 1 to 4): 
 
    M(Iscn, Colat) =   Mmod  (Iscn, Colat)                
 
 
 
+ Fc [Mgeo(Colat, Lon) -    Mmod  (Ngeo, Colat)]    ---(2) 
 
where Fc is is related to the cloud fraction 
Fc  = 1 for clear  
Fc  = 0.75 for partly cloudy 
Fc  = 0.25 for mostly cloudy  
Fc  = 0 for overcast 
It is easy to check:    
M (Iscn, Colat) =   Mmod  (Iscn, Colat)   for overcast 
M (Iscn, Colat) =   Mgeo(Colat, Lon) for clear sky 
 
Step-3 Compute the theoretical LW radiance LLW                                                          
 
LLW = [ R (Iscn, ’, Colat) . M(Iscn, Colat) ] / 
 
                    ---(3) 
 
where R is the anisotropic factor 
 
Step-4 Compare the measured radiance to theoretical radiance

5.2.1.4 Scene Identification for day time 
The algorithm is similar to night time algorithm, except it deals with the LW - SW 
pair instead to LW alone. 
 
Step-1 Search the geographic information Ngeo 
From latitude and longitude, the following variables are searched: 
Ngeo  : geotype (ocean, land, desert, snow-ice, coast)  
Mgeo : the outgoing clear sky flux (Wm-2) 
ageo  : the clear sky albedo  
The Mgeo  and ageo dataset are defined on monthly basis. The Mgeo corresponding 
to land and desert are corrected for diurnal variations. 
 
Step-2 Compute the theoretical albedo â from ageo and ADM 
For each cloud category ( 1 to 4): 
 
    â (Iscn, ’) =   amod  (Iscn, ’)                
 
 
+ Fc [ageo(Colat, Lon). ( ’ )  -   amod   (Ngeo, ’)]      ---(6) 
 
where Fc is related to the cloud fraction, and has been defined above in the ‘night 
time’ section 
 
It is easy to check:    
 
 â (Iscn, ’) =   amod  (Iscn, ’)   for overcast 
â (Iscn, ’) =  ageo(Colat, Lon). ( ’ ) for clear sky 
 
 
Step-3 Compute the theoretical SW radiance LSW  
LSW = [ (Iscn, ’, ’, ’) â (Iscn, ’)] (E0 cos(’) /                   ---(7) 
 
 
where  is the anisotropic bi-directional factor 
 
Step-4 Compute the theoretical LW radiance LLW  
Similarly as in the night-time section 
 
LLW = [ R (Iscn, ’, Colat) . M(Iscn, Colat) ] / 

                    ---(8) 
 
where R is the anisotropic factor 
 
Step-5 Compare the pair of measured radiances to theoretical radiances  
 
For each cloud category ( 1 to 4):

5.2.1.5 Flux Computation 
The flux density F() is the integration of the radiances in the hemisphere 
 
 
                                                                                                                 ---(11) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As discussed earlier, the radiance-to-flux computation is based on the ‘angular

6.2 Introduction 
Temperature, pressure and humidity information are, inter-alia, vital information 
as to the state of the atmosphere, of critical importance to studies of weather and 
climate. GPS-Radio Occultation (GPS-RO) based retrieval of these atmospheric 
parameters is a relatively novel approach to limb sounding technique, with the 
constellation of GPS satellites and deployed Low Earth Orbit (LEO) receiver/s 
constituting its gross measurement system.  
ROSA, onboard MEGHA-TROPIQUES, is the deployed GPS receiver in context 
tracking L-band dual-frequency signals transmitted by GPS satellites.

The orbital specification of Megha-Tropiques combined with ROSA receiver 
specification, is likely to result in occultation event frequency in excess of 500 per 
day with spatial coverage from 30S – 30N latitude. Multiple space-based GPS 
receivers are configured to give increased occultation events. Currently, COSMIC, 
which is a constellation of six receivers, is a multiple-receiver mission yielding 
between 1800-2500 occultations per day and a dense coverage of mid-latitude 
region.  
This document is primarily concerned with the delineation and description of 
conceptual constructs in the retrieval of afore-mentioned geophysical parameters 
Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0

from GPS-RO derived refractivity and the associated elements in development of 
the algorithm for the same and its operational implementation. A meaningful 
starting point for this purpose is the relationship, also called forward model, 
between the derived refractivity and geophysical parameters to be retrieved viz. 
temperature (T), pressure (P) and water vapor partial pressure (e). However, a 
brief overview of the theoretical background of the GPS-RO technique, beginning 
with the raw measurements to the derivation of refractivity, is given for greater 
comprehension and continuity. 
 
6.2.1 Theoretical Background 
The basic observables of this technique are the phase and amplitude of the dual-
frequency signals transmitted by a GPS satellite and received by the LEO receiver 
in an occulting geometry as depicted in Fig.1. The recorded phase, corresponding 
to a single frequency, is the sum of vacuum phase and an excess phase, due to the 
intervening atmosphere. Obtaining excess phase delay involves precise 
measurement of GPS and LEO satellite orbits (position and velocities) and phase 
delays of GPS signals (at L1 and L2 frequencies) to a very high accuracy. From 
the time series of excess phase delay (obtained after removing vacuum phase 
delay from measured phase delay) and position and velocities of GPS and LEO, 
bending angle profile as a function of impact parameter is computed.       
                                        
 
Figure 1. A schematic diagram of radio occultation sounding geometry 
The main steps involved in the retrieval of refractivity and related atmospheric 
parameters are as follows (Steiner et al., 1999):  
1. Calculation of the atmospheric bending angle profile from the observed 
L1/L2 excess phase path time series (including dual-frequency ionospheric 
correction). 
2. Retrieval of the refractive index profile from the atmospheric bending 
angle profile and conversion to refractivity profile. 
3. Calculation of pressure, and temperature based on the refractivity profile 
(assuming dry air). The pressure and temperature so calculated are the dry 
pressure and dry temperature, distinct from real pressure and temperature 
in the water vapor dominant region (i.e. lower troposphere). 
4. Deriving water vapor partial pressure with a simultaneous refinement of 
dry temperature and pressure to get real state parameters.

6.2.1.1 Bending angle calculation: 
GPS-LEO occultation geometry defining the atmospheric bending angle (), the 
impact parameter (a), and the radius of the ray tangent point (r) is shown in Figure 
1. The impact parameter (a) is defined, assuming spherical symmetry, as the 
perpendicular distance between the center of the Earth (more precisely the center 
of local curvature at the perigee of the occultation ray) and the ray asymptote at 
the GPS or LEO satellite. The atmospheric Doppler shift, f, can be related to the 
direction of the transmitted and received signals by the expression

vt and vr – the transmitter (GPS) and receiver’s (LEO) velocity respectively. 
kt and kr – unit vectors in the direction of transmitted and received signal, 
respectively. 
kˆ  - Unit vector in the direction from the transmitter to the receiver. 
Equation (1) is difference of Doppler shift observed in the presence of the 
atmosphere and the Doppler shift that would be observed for the same transmitter-
receiver geometry in the absence of the atmosphere. The first order relativistic 
contributions to the Doppler are identical in the two situations and cancel out. 
Equation (1) holds for atmosphere of any shape. However, (1) also has infinite 
number of solutions, since kt and kr are unknown, corresponding to four 
independent parameters. Therefore, certain assumptions have to be made on the 
shape of the atmosphere in order to derive the atmospheric bending from equation 
(1).To a good approximation, the neutral atmosphere is spherically symmetric. In 
order to account for the ellipticity of the Earth, the center of symmetry is taken to 
correspond to the circle of occultation plane which best fits the geoid near the 
tangent point. With the spherical symmetry assumption, equation (1) reduces to 
two equations in two unknowns

symmetric medium). 
rr  and rt are the vectors from the center of curvature to transmitter and receiver,

At the heights of the transmitter (~ 20000 km) and receiver (low earth orbit), the 
indices of refraction are assumed to be equal to 1. This approximation can be 
shown to introduce a very small error in the estimated bending in the ionosphere 
and it cancels completely after doing ionospheric calibration to estimate neutral 
atmospheric bending. The angles t and r are determined by simultaneously 
solving equations 2(a) and 2(b) (easily accomplished using Newton’s method and 
a first guess of t=0 and r=0). The total bending angle is =t+r and the 
corresponding impact parameter ‘a’ is obtained by equation 2(b). 
If 1(a1) and 2(a2) be the bending angle as a function of the asymptotic miss 
distance for the L1 and L2 signals, respectively, then the linear combination

where 1 and 2 are interpolated to the same value of a0, removes first-order 
ionospheric bending (which is proportional to f  -2). The calibration should not 
continue above a certain height, when the neutral atmosphere signature on the 
occulted signal is comparable to residual ionospheric effects or the receiver’s 
thermal noise. 
Deeper in the atmosphere, due to defocusing effects and the weakening of the 
signal, the L2 signal is not used when the signal to noise ratio drops below a 
certain limit. In that case, an extrapolation of the ionosphere correction is used 
from higher altitudes to correct for the ionosphere (Hocke 1997, Hocke et al., 
1997). 
6.2.1.2 Retrieval of refractive index profile: 
Inverse Abel transform technique is used to retrieve refractive index profile from 
bending angle profile (Hajj et al., 1995; Kursinski et al., 1996; Hocke 1997). 
Bending angle i(ai) and the refractive index n at the perigee location of the ray is 
given by the forward Abel transform (e.g. Fjeldbo et al., 1971):

The upper limit of integral equation (5) requires knowledge of bending angle as a 
function of impact parameter up to the top of the atmosphere. In practice however, 
the estimated bending is reasonably accurate only up to a certain upper height, au. 
The refractivity profile is calculated by upward scaling of refractive index profile

The refractivity, derived as a function of impact parameter, is redefined on a mean 
sea level altitude relative to the Earth’s geoid so as to relate it to the geophysical 
parameters of temperature, pressure and water vapor partial pressure in the geoid 
frame.

with a1=77.6 K/mbar; a2=3.73x105 K2/mbar; P – the total pressure; T – 
temperature; e – water vapor partial pressure; ne – electron number density (m-
3); f – operating frequency (Hz); Ww and Wi  being liquid water and ice content 
respectively in grams per cubic meter, aw and ai are 1.4 and 0.6 (cubic 
meter/grams) respectively. The first (second) term in equation (7) is usually 
known as hydrostatic (or, dry) term (wet term).  
For realistic suspensions of water and ice, the last two terms of (7) are small in 
comparison with other terms and are neglected for practical purposes (Hajj et al. 
2002). When the signal is passing through the ionosphere the first two terms of 
(7) can be ignored, as well as higher order ionospheric terms. Therefore, 
measurement of n directly corresponds to electron density in the ionosphere. 
In the neutral atmosphere (tangent point height < 60 km), the ionospheric 
calibration process effectively removes the first order ionosphere term (1/f2) in 
(7). In order to solve for P, T and/or e, given N, one has to use additional 
constraints of hydrostatic equilibrium and the ideal gas law:

Given N, we have a system of two equations ((7) and (10)) and three unknowns 
(T, P, and e). Since saturation vapor pressure decreases rapidly with decreasing 
temperature, e can be ignored above the tropospheric height corresponding to 
230 K; therefore given N, both T and P can be solved for in the upper 
troposphere and stratosphere from (7) and (10) and a boundary condition 
(usually taken to be a temperature boundary condition at ~60 km estimated from 
a climatology or an atmospheric model). What we get are the “dry” temperature 
and pressure, accurate to real temperature and pressure in the water vapor scarce 
Megha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0

region obtained in the upper troposphere and beyond. The “dry” T has a cold 
bias in the lower troposphere below 230K as shown in figure 3.  
                      
 
Figure 3. A depiction of cold bias in “dry” temperature below 10km  
Realistic temperature and pressure profile require inclusion of water vapor 
pressure (e) term in equation (7) and (10) for retrieval below 230K. This 
demarcation at  
230K temperature is defined as the water vapor point (O’ Sullivan et al. 2000). 
The water vapor point is observed to vary in different latitude zones. For the 
tropics (30S-30N), the water vapor point at 230K is determined through  a 
sensitivity study of the error statistics of retrieved T, P and e from refractivity, N 
to different choices of water vapor point (Shyam et al., 2009). In altitude terms, 
the water vapor point for the tropics range from 10-12km. Below this altitude, 
water vapor has a non-negligible concentration and contributes significantly to 
refractivity. Thus, the algorithm goes for a composite retrieval (to be called “Wet 
retrieval”) of all the three unknowns simultaneously.  
“Wet” Retrieval   
The algorithm approximates temperature, for the region below the “water vapor 
point (wvp)”, to be a quadratic function of the natural logarithm of atmospheric 
pressure.  Between the estimated water vapor point and the surface (or, the lowest 
altitude at which a’ priori P and T are available), temperature is assumed to vary 
as a quadratic function of natural logarithm of P (denoted by σ) i.e. T (σ) = a + 
b*σ + c*σ2. We have T and σ at water vapor point, where the dry temperature and 
pressure are approximated as actual temperature and pressure and the surface 
(known from meteorological observations or reanalysis of Numerical weather 
prediction models like ECMWF or NCEP), giving two equations for the 
temperature quadratic i.e.,

The right hand side of (13) is evaluated by approximating the gas constant for air 
(Rair), as that of dry air (Rdry), as we do not have any knowledge of water vapor in 
the beginning. Solving equations (11) to (13), one obtains the three coefficients 
for the temperature quadratic. Once a first estimate of temperature quadratic is 
made, temperature profile in the first iteration is evaluated using dry pressure and 
water vapor pressure is calculated using the equation

Where, Pw is pressure at the water vapor point zw. 
 
 Re-estimated pressure is then used to calculate temperature, water vapor (and 
virtual temperature) profiles in successive iterations until the three profiles 
converge. It is worth noting that two options are possible here (not pointed out by 
O’Sullivan et al. (2000)): (i) keep the coefficients of temperature quadratic same 
throughout the iterations with R=Rdry approximation in equation (13), and (ii) 
update the right hand side integral in equation (13) with water vapor information 
and hence solve for fresh temperature quadratic coefficients in each iteration 
which requires refractivity profile available up to the surface or lower altitude. 
Currently, only the first option is considered as the radio occultation derived 
refractivity profiles do not reach the surface and are often available only up to 
altitudes of 1 km and above only. Also, knowledge of near-surface refractivity 
requires information on surface specific humidity and hence in practice the second 
option is not feasible. 
6.4 Operational Implementation  
For ease of operational implementation, the algorithm will be formalized into a 
software to be designed and developed in a modular fashion. Different functions 
of the algorithm, as compositely shown in the flowchart in the following sub-
section, will be divided into five sub-modules, the first four sub-modules 
performing specific pre-processing of the principal input (i.e. Level-1 refractivity 
profile) as well as the auxiliary data, dry computation and water vapor point

6.6 Technical Issues: 
 Radio occultation measurements are over a location of the earth depending 
on the position of GPS and LEO satellites. The exact location over which 
radio occultation measurements are possible, require prior knowledge of 
GPS and Megha-Tropiques orbit. One may expect 500 to 800 occultations 
per day spread in the domain (30S-30N; 180W-180E) with dense 
occurrence around 10-20S/N. 
 Theoretically, the GPS-RO data of reliable quality may range from 0 – 
60km in the neutral atmosphere. Practically, the measurements are reliable 
between altitudes of 5 to 30 km height, irrespective of the atmospheric 
dynamics. Since, ROSA coverage will be confined to the tropics where 
moisture gradients creates multipath conditions, advanced techniques to 
retrieve refractivity profile by an open-loop processing as implemented in 
global missions like COSMIC, GRAS etc., may be required to penetrate to 
near surface altitudes ~ 0.1 km or less. Examination of COSMIC profiles 
over the ocean indicates that more than 90% of the radio occultation 
refractivity measurements are available up to an altitude of 0.5 km from 
the mean sea level. 
 The algorithm uses the CIRA-86 COSPAR upper-air atmospheric model 
data of zonal mean temperature and pressure available up to 120km for the 
computation of hydrostatic integral. The accuracy of the upper-air data as 
quoted by COSPAR has been assumed suo motu, in the absence of ways to 
validate them. 
 The monthly mean surface temperature, pressure and altitude data are 
generated from NCEP analyses at global grid of 1deg x1 deg resolution as 
first guess estimates. The standard deviations (all months and for 30S-
30N) of mean surface temperature and mean surface pressure are ~ 1K and 
0.05-2.0hPa respectively. To get a more accurate first guess, the use of 
daily forecast of NCEP, nearest to ROSA occultation event time and 
location is imperative.
