1.0 Introduction 
 
The SCATSAT1 is an active Scatterometer designed to measure ocean surface wind 
velocity. The sensor transmits signals at regular interval and receives energy back 
scattered by the targets on the Earth. The DPGS generates Level 1B product from the 
sensor data. The Level 1B product carries back scattering coefficient (or sigma0) and 
other radiometric parameters along with geolocation information. The Level 4 products 
are generated from Level 1B products.  
This document describes format of Level 4 products of SCATSAT1 (operational version 
1.0). These are high resolution products and are generated using Scatterometer Image 
Reconstruction (or SIR) technique.  
Currently, three parameters are given as a product: sigma0, gamma0 and brightness 
temperature. Depending on geo location extent, various categories of a product are 
defined. Depending on combinations of polarization/pass/look and temporal extent of 
data, various sub-categories of Level 4 products are defined. For a product (say, of 
sigma0, gamma0 or brightness temperature), the categories are described in Table 1 
below:

The Polar products will be having data for all the features such as land, ocean or ice. 
However, Global and India products will be having data for pure land only. The product 
format is GeoTIFF. The India Products and Global Products are defined in geographic 
lat-lon grid. The Polar products are defined in Polar Projection as specified by NPs.mpp 
and SPs.mpp of NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Centre) maps library. The EPSG 
codes for North and South polar projection defined by NPs.mpp and SPs.mpp are 3411 
and 3412 respectively. The spatial resolution of INDIA products for all parameters is 
0.02°. The spatial resolution of GLOBAL sigma0 and gamma0 products is 0.02°, 
whereas spatial resolution of GLOBAL brightness temperature product is 0.0625°. The 
details are given in Table 3 below:

2.0 Details of Product Format:  
 
All products of Level 4 are supplied in GeoTIFF format. The brief introduction of the 
format is presented in section 2.1. Relevant information about Level 4 product is placed 
in next sub section. 
 
2.1 Details of GeoTIFF:  
Remote sensing and its applications use data in digital form. These datasets generally 
contain digital image along with other information which are further used for data 
interpretation and other applications. Different communities use these data for their 
required purpose. To make it convenient to the users, standards are required to store these 
datasets. Many image file formats like GIF, PGM, BMP, JPEG etc. are available 
globally. These formats have an image header with fixed fields containing information 
such as image dimensions, color space specification, etc.  
However, these formats have no facility to store information related to geo-location of 
image pixels. They also do not support storage of cartographic data. Due to these 
limitations, a new format is required to store image data along with image geometry as 
well as cartographic information along with ancillary information required for further 
processing. The new format has to be platform independent, flexible and extensible. The 
Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) is one of the popularly available image formats. It is 
platform independent extensible. Several third party solutions exist for recording

cartographic information using TIFF tags. The specifications for these tags (fields) are 
available in TIFF-6.0 documents. These fields contain information ranging from the most 
primary, like image dimensions, over the most sophisticated information like copyright, 
up to so-called 'private tags' or 'custom tags' that can define to hold application-specific 
information. The TIFF specification defines a framework for an image header called 
'IFD' (Image File Directory) that is essentially a flexible set of specifically those tags that 
the TIFF writer software wishes to specify.  
The TIFF file format can be used to store and digital satellite image data, scanned aerial 
photos, elevation models, scanned maps and the results of many types of geographic 
analysis. TIFF is the only full-featured format in the public domain, capable of 
supporting extension to include geographic metadata. GeoTIFF implements the 
geographic metadata formally, using compliant TIFF tags and structures. A GeoTIFF file 
actually contains geographic (or cartographic) data attached as tags within the TIFF file. 
The geographic data can then be used to position the image in the correct location and 
geometry on the screen of a geographic information display. GeoTIFF is a metadata 
format, which provides geographic information to associate with the image data. But the 
TIFF file structure allows both the metadata and the image data to be encoded into the 
same file. GeoTIFF makes use of a public tag structure which is platform interoperable 
between any and all GeoTIFF- readers. 
The GeoTIFF format is supported by TIFF – 6.0. That is, the GeoTIFF images conform 
in every way to the TIFF formal specifications. The tags used for the "Geo" portion of 
the TIFF format conform to the acceptable and customary use of "private" or "registered" 
TIFF tags. The GeoTIFF tags and definitions are considered completely to the baseline 
and extended TIFF tag definitions currently supported in TIFF-6 by Aldus Corp.  
 
2.2 Details of Level 4 products: 
 
A set of geographic parameters required to interpret the product for each category has 
been defined. This set is used for placing geographic information in GeoTIFF in form of 
tags (or keys). The sets for various categories of products are shown in Table 4 below:

The data part of the product carries the parameter values in range defined by minimum 
and maximum defined in Table 5 below. Any value out of this range is clipped (to lower 
or upper bound of range) appropriately. The image pixels are coded as unsigned short 
integer using slope and offset. The slope and offset are mentioned in the corresponding 
xml file. The BT value can be obtained from unsigned short integer value as shown by 
equation 1. The sigma0 or gamma0 value can be obtained from unsigned integer value as 
shown by equations 2 to 7. Basically, LSB of sigma0 or gamma0 product carries the sign 
of parameter in linear scale. Rest of the bits carry sigma0/gamma0 value in dB. 
For BT: 
BT_value_in_degK = unsigned_short_int_value*slope + offset 
 
 
(1) 
For sigma0 and gamma0: 
intermediate_value = unsigned_short_int_value AND (0xFFFE) 
 
 
(2) 
sign_bit = unsigned_short_int_value AND (0x0001)  
 
 
 
(3) 
para_value_in_dB = intermediate_value*slope + offset 
 
 
 
(4) 
sign_value = -1 if sign_bit = 1 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(5) 
sign_value =  1 if sign_bit = 0 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(6) 
para_value_in_linear_scale = sign_value*10.0^(para_value_in_dB/10.0)  
(7) 
 
The absence of parameter is denoted by coded value of 65535. So, value of parameter 
should be computed only if coded value is not equal to 65535.

6.0 Product Generation and Dissemination 
 
The SCATSAT1 Level 4 data products are generated at MOSDAC using Level 1B data 
products. The Data Product Generation System is installed at MOSDAC. The DPGS 
regularly fetches L1B products and invokes product generation software for all kinds of 
Level 4 products. After generation of products, the DPGS uploads product files on 
MOSDAC site.  
The products are disseminated from the MOSDAC site (www.mosdac.gov.in). Along 
with the products in GeoTIFF format, browse jpeg images and xml metadata files are 
made available to the users. The users can search the products based on information in 
xml files and view the product using browse images.
