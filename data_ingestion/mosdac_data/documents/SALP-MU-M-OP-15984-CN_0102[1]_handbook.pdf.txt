1. Introduction 
SARAL/AltiKa is a follow-on mission to ENVISAT ESA’s mission and will have the same ground track. 
The satellite name SARAL stands for SAtellite for ARgos and ALtiKa. This mission continues the 
series of successful altimetric missions such as TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason missions. While they 
were conducted under a cooperation between the French Space Agency, "Centre National d'Etudes 
Spatiales" (CNES), the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the 
European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), SARAL/AltiKa is a new collaboration 
between CNES and ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization). 
1.1. Overview of the SARAL/AltiKa product family 
The purpose of this document is to assist users of the SARAL/AltiKa products (Operational 
Geophysical Data Record : OGDR, Interim Geophysical Data Record : IGDR, and Geophysical Data 
Record : GDR) by providing a comprehensive description of product content and format. We will so 
refer to (O)(I)GDR in this document when the information is relevant for all the products.  
(O)(I)GDR products are identical except for the following differences regarding the auxiliary data 
used in the processing:

Table 1 : Differences between Auxiliary Data for O/I/GDR Products 
GDR products, unlike OGDR and IGDR products, are fully validated products. 
1.1.1. Product contents 
The Level-2 products from this mission comprise a family of nine different types of geophysical data 
records (GDRs). As illustrated in Table 1 below, there are three families of GDRs, distinguished by 
increasing latency and accuracy, going from the Operational GDR (OGDR), to the Interim GDR 
(IGDR), to the final GDR. Within each of these three families there are up to three types of files in 
NetCDF format, with increasing size and complexity:  
1. a reduced 1 Hz subset of the full dataset in NetCDF format (O/I/GDR-SSHA); 
 
SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  
 
Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011

2. the native NetCDF formatted datasets (O/I/GDRs) which contain 1Hz records as well as 20 
Hz high-rate values; 
 
3. an expert sensor product containing the full radar-echo waveforms in NetCDF format (S-
IGDR/S-GDR, not applicable to the OGDR).  
 
 
 
Table 1. Summary of operational, interim, and final geophysical data record 
products (O/I/GDR) from the SARAL/AltiKa mission. 
 
All nine files contain sea surface height, ocean surface wind speed, significant wave height 
information and all required corrections. The NetCDF files differ in the amount and type of auxiliary 
data included but the product format is the same.  
1.1.2. Filename conventions 
The product names are based on the following convention: 
      
With :   <O/I/G> : product family (O : OGDR, I : IGDR, G: GDR) 
 
<N/R/S> : product type (N : native, R: reduced, S : sensor) 
<v> : product version (set to ‘T’ during CalVal phases, then set to the current altimetric 
version from data standards) 
 
<S/P> : product duration (S : segment for OGDR, P : pass for I/GDR) 
 
<ccc>: cycle number of 1st product record 
 
<pppp> : pass number of 1st product record (1-1002) 
 
<yyyymmdd_hhnnss> : date of 1st product record 
 
<yyyymmdd_hhnnss> : date of last product record 
<aaaa> : Name of the agency producing the data (EUM/CNES/ISRO)

1.4. Conventions 
1.4.1. Vocabulary 
1.4.1.1. Altimetric distances 
In order to reduce confusion in discussing altimeter measurements and corrections, the following 
terms are used in this document as defined below:  
· 
Distance and Length are general terms with no special meaning in this document 
· 
Range is the distance from the satellite to the surface of the Earth, as measured by the 
altimeter. Thus, the altimeter measurement is referred to as "range" or "altimeter range," 
not height 
· 
Altitude is the distance of the satellite or altimeter above a reference point. The reference 
point used is the reference ellipsoid. This distance is computed from the satellite 
ephemeris data 
· 
Height is the distance of the sea surface above the reference ellipsoid. The sea surface 
height is the difference of the altimeter range from the satellite altitude above the 
reference ellipsoid

1.4.1.2. Orbits, Revolutions, Passes, and Repeat Cycles 
An Orbit is one circuit of the earth by the satellite as measured from one ascending node crossing 
to the next. An ascending node occurs when the sub satellite point crosses the earth's equator going 
from south to north. A Revolution (REV) is synonymous with orbit.  
The OGDR data is organized into files (“segments”) which corresponds to the amount of data 
dumped over an Earth terminal (typically 2 hour-data sets). 
The (I)GDR data is organized into pass files in order to avoid having data boundaries in the middle 
of the oceans, as would happen if the data were organized by orbit. A Pass is half a revolution of 
the earth by the satellite from extreme latitude to the opposite extreme latitude. 
 
SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  
 
Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 
6 
 
 
 
For SARAL/AltiKa, an Ascending Pass begins at the latitude -81.49 deg and ends at +81.49 deg. A 
Descending Pass is the opposite (+81.49 deg to -81.49 deg). The passes are numbered from 1 to 501 
representing a full repeat cycle of the SARAL/AltiKa ground track. Ascending passes are odd 
numbered and descending passes are even numbered.  
After one repeat cycle of 501 passes, SARAL/AltiKa revisits the same ground-track within a margin 
of ±1 km. That means that every location along the SARAL/AltiKa ground-track is measured every 
approximately 35 days.  
1.4.1.3. Reference Ellipsoid 
The Reference Ellipsoid is the first-order definition of the non-spherical shape of the Earth as an 
ellipsoid of revolution with equatorial radius of 6378.1363 kilometers and a flattening coefficient of 
1/298.257 (same reference ellipsoid as used by the Jason-1, SARAL/AltiKa and the T/P missions). 
1.4.2. Correction Conventions 
All environmental and instrument corrections are computed so that they should be added to the 
quantity which they correct. That is, a correction is applied to a measured value by  
 
Corrected Quantity = Measured Value + Correction 
This means that a correction to the altimeter range for an effect that lengthens the apparent signal 
path (e.g., wet troposphere correction) is computed as a negative number. Adding this negative 
number to the uncorrected (measured) range reduces the range from its original value toward the 
correct value. Example: Corrected Range = Measured Range + Range Correction. 
1.4.3. Time Convention 
Times are UTC and referenced to January 1, 2000 00:00:00.00.  
A UTC leap second can occur on June 30 or December 31 of any year. The leap second is a sixty-first 
second introduced in the last minute of the day. Thus the UTC values (minutes:seconds) appear as: 
59:58 ; 59:59 ; 59:60 ; 00:00 ; 00:01.  
1.4.4. Unit Convention 
All distances and distance corrections are reported in tenths of millimeters (10-1 mm).  
1.4.5. Flagging and Editing 
In general, flagging consists of three parts: instrument flags (on/off), telemetry flags (preliminary 
flagging and editing) and data quality flags (geophysical processing flags).  
Instrument flags provide information about the state of the various instruments on the satellite.  
Telemetry flags are first based on instrument modes and checking of telemetry data quality. Only 
severely corrupted data are not processed (i.e. data that cannot be correctly read on ground). Flag 
setting is designed to get a maximum amount of data into the “Sensor Data Records” (part of the 
SGDR data sets). Science data are processed only when the altimeter is in tracking mode. 
Quality flags are determined from various statistical checks on the residuals after smoothing or 
fitting through the data themselves. These flags are set if gaps in the data are detected, or

2. SARAL/AltiKa Mission Overview 
2.1. Altimetric background 
Three previous high-accuracy altimetric missions, TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P, launched in August 1992 
and which last until October 2005), Jason-1 (launched in December 2001) and Jason-2 (launched in 
June 2008) have been the key elements of a major turning point in physical oceanography, in terms 
of both scientific research and applications. Exceeding most initial specifications in terms of 
accuracy, T/P quickly became a unique tool to make significant progress in the understanding and 
modeling of ocean circulation and consequently on its climatic impact. The success of the T/P 
mission was mainly due to an appropriate optimization of the system: instruments, satellite, and 
orbit parameters were all specifically designed to fulfill the objectives of the mission. The T/P 
follow-on mission, Jason-1, was engaged soon after with the aim to provide the same level of 
performance, but with a significant decrease in weight and power needs, hence a much lower 
mission cost. In addition, near-real time applications were included in the main objectives of the 
mission. Jason-2 presents better tracking performance and continue the success story of altimetric 
missions.  
These missions, individually as well as combined have made essential contributions in other 
domains, like mean sea level surveys, tides, marine meteorology, geophysics and geodesy. Most 
notably the tandem mission phase, where Jason-1 and T/P or Jason-1 and Jason-2 were flying on 
the same orbit separated by only 70 s or 1 min, provided a unique opportunity for intercalibration 
of both systems, hence improving further the scientific data quality. High accuracy radar altimeter 
missions are uniquely capable to globally and continuously observe the ocean and to better 
understand the short to long term changes of ocean circulation. They are now considered as 
essential components of global ocean observation systems. These systems integrate altimetric and 
other satellite and in-situ data into models and require the continuity and permanence of ocean 
measurements to produce time series over several decades.  
The near-real time and short term capability of Jason-1, Jason-2 as well as ENVISAT (from ESA, 
launched in March 2002) have fed several pilot experiments that demonstrated the growing 
importance of operational ocean observation products and short-range ocean prediction for a 
variety of applications (ship routing, environmental hazards, support to maritime industries).  
Also worth mentioning is the importance of wave and wind data provided by altimeter systems over 
oceans. This information is routinely used in meteorological and research entities, either for 
calibration of other data sets, assimilation in weather and wave models, or for statistical analysis. 
2.2. Introduction to SARAL/AltiKa mission 
2.2.1. Mission overview 
The SARAL mission results from the common interest of both CNES and ISRO in studying ocean from 
space using altimetry system and in promoting maximum use of the ARGOS Data Collecting System. 
In the present document, we focus on the AltiKa part of the overall SARAL mission. 
Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the 
oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of 
altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the 
Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and 
ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the 
century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from 
secular variations.

SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise 
and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. 
Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed 
to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by 
ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. 
The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 
1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will 
supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a 
better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The 
drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation. 
The SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, 
and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter 
jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1.  
By ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish 
of the oceanography community by bringing a description: 
• 
for the meso-scale in open ocean, 
• 
in coastal areas, 
• 
for the seasonal forecast, 
• 
for the hydrology, 
• 
for the climate studies. 
AltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the 
development of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of 
forecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled ocean-
atmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc. 
2.2.2. Mission objectives 
SARAL/AltiKa main scientific objective is to provide data products to oceanographic research user 
community in studies leading to improve our knowledge of the ocean meso-scale variability, 
thanks to the improvement in spatial and vertical resolution brought by SARAL/AltiKa. 
Ocean meso-scale variability is defined as a class of high-energy processes, with wave lengths 
within a 50km to 500km range, and with periods of a few days to one year. Kinetic energy of meso-
scale variability is one order of magnitude more than mean circulation’s one. Description of meso-
scale is thus essential for understanding ocean dynamics, including mean circulation and its climatic 
effects (through interactions of meso-scale turbulence with the mean flow). 
SARAL/AltiKa main scientific objective is divided in sub-themes including: 
• 
intrinsic scientific studies of ocean at meso-scale dynamics: observations, theoretical 
analyses,  modelling, data assimilation, parameterization, ... 
• 
improvement of our understanding of the oceanic component in the climate system: 
investigation of local processes at small or medium scale poorly known and understood 
at present, but which have an impact on the modelling of climate variability at large 
spatial and temporal scales. 
• 
contribution to the study of coastal dynamic processes, especially small or medium 
scale phenomena, whose retrieval will enable to anticipate many downstream 
applications. 
• 
contribution to operational oceanography which is seeking large amounts of in situ and 
space observation data.

SARAL/AltiKa secondary objectives are notably the monitoring of the main continental waters level 
(lakes, rivers, closed seas), the monitoring of mean sea level variations, the observation of polar 
oceans, the analysis and forecast of wave and wind fields, the study of continental ices (thanks to 
improved performances of Ka-band) and sea ices, the access to low rains climatology (enabled in 
counterpart to the sensitivity of Ka-band to clouds and low rains) and the marine biogeochemistry 
(notably through the role of the meso and sub-meso-scale physics).

The SARAL satellite is planned to operate for a nominal period of five (5) years, with an objective 
at 7 years. However, the operations will be conducted throughout the whole SARAL satellite 
lifetime. 
SARAL/AltiKa was launched on X X 2012 at 0:00 GMT by a PSLV vehicle supplied by ISRO, from the 
main ISRO launch base, the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, SHAR SRIHARIKOTA, 100 km North from 
Chennai. It reached it’s nominal repetitive orbit on X X 2012. The start of cycle 1 occurred on X X 
2012 at 00:00:00 GMT.  
2.4. SARAL/AltiKa Requirements 
The major elements of the mission include: 
• 
An Earth orbiting satellite carrying an altimetric system for measuring the height of the 
satellite above the sea surface 
• 
A precision orbit determination system for referring the altimetric measurements to 
geodetic coordinates 
• 
A data analysis and distribution system for processing the satellite data, verifying their 
accuracy, and making them available to the scientific community 
• 
A Principal Investigator program for feedback from operational applications and scientific 
studies based on the satellite observations  
The sea-surface height measurement must be made with an accuracy of 3.4 cm or better (at 1 Hz) 
in order to meet the mission objectives. The SARAL/AltiKa satellite is specified and designed to 
fulfill the mission objectives (see AD 6) and to take over from the Jason-1/2 mission. As for Jason-
1/2, distribution of altimetric products (non-validated) in near real time is planned. The interim 
(IGDR) and definitive (GDR) science products are delivered later (within 1.5 days for IGDR and 
within 40 days for GDR), following the model used for Jason-1 and Jason-2. 
To ensure that science and mission goals are accomplished by the SARAL/AltiKa mission, the 
following requirements were established.

2.4.1. Accuracy of Sea-level Measurements 
Generally speaking SARAL/AltiKa has been specified based on the Jason-2 state of the art, including 
improvements in payload technology, data processing and algorithms or ancillary data (e.g: precise 
orbit determination and meteorological model accuracy). The sea-surface height shall be provided 
with a globally averaged RMS accuracy of 4.6 cm (1 sigma), or better, assuming 1 second averages.  
The instrumental and environmental corrections are provided with the appropriate accuracy to 
meet this requirement. In addition to these requirements, a set of measurement-system goals was 
established based on the anticipated impact of off-line ground processing improvements. These 
improvements are expected to enable reduction of sea-surface height errors to 2.8 cm RMS. 
Knowledge of the stability of the system is especially important to the goal of monitoring the 
change in the global mean sea level, hence a specification on the system drift with a 1 mm/year 
goal.

2.4.2. Sampling Strategy 
As for Jason-1 and Jason-2, sea level shall be measured along a fixed grid of subsatellite tracks such 
that it is possible to investigate and minimize the spatial and temporal aliases of surface 
geostrophic currents and to minimize the influence of the geoid on measurements of the time-
varying topography.

2.4.3. Tidal Aliases 
As for Jason-1 and Jason-2, sea level shall be measured such that tidal signals are not aliased into 
semiannual, annual, or zero frequencies (which influences the calculation of the permanent 
circulation) or frequencies close to these.  
2.4.4. Duration and coverage 
Sea level shall be measured for a minimum of five years, with the potential to extend this period 
for an additional two years.  
The SARAL/AltiKa satellite shall overfly the reference ENVISAT ground tracks.  
2.5. Mission Description 
SARAL/AltiKa will use an Earth orbiting satellite equipped with a radar altimeter and other 
instruments to directly measure sea-surface elevation along the fixed grid of sub-satellite ground 
tracks traced out by the ERS1/2 and ENVISAT satellites. In so doing, SARAL/AltiKa will continue the 
data collection started with ERS1/2 and followed by ENVISAT. The sea-surface height measurement 
must be made with an accuracy of 4.6 cm or better (at 1 Hz) in order to meet the mission 
objectives. The SARAL/AltiKa satellite is specified and designed to fulfill the mission objectives and 
will be launched in 2012 to take over for ENVISAT mission.  
The ocean topography is obtained through three basic measurements:  
1) the satellite range above the sea surface derived from the altimeter,  
2) the tropospheric range delay measured by the radiometer to correct the altimeter range,  
3) the altitude of the satellite above the reference ellipsoid derived from precise orbit 
determination.

Figure 2. Geometry of the sea surface height measurement by altimetry 
The altimeter uses radar pulses to determine precisely the distance between the satellite and the 
ocean surface by measuring the time taken by the emitted pulse to return. The shape and the 
amplitude of the echo enable the estimation of wave height and wind speed respectively. 
Geophysical corrections are then applied to compensate for the measurement errors introduced by 
propagation through the troposphere and ionosphere and errors induced by sea state.

2.6.2. Sensors 
2.6.2.1. AltiKa Altimeter 
The mono-frequency Ka-band (35.75 GHz) radar altimeter is the main part of AltiKa instrument. Its 
functions are based on proven concepts and already developed sub-systems, as it inherits from Siral 
(CRYOSAT mission) and Poseidon3 (Jason-2 mission). 
The use of a single frequency is possible because ionosphere effects are negligible at such high 
frequencies (proportionality to the inverse of the squared frequency).  
The main advantage of this higher frequency (Ka versus classical Ku/C altimeters) is the reduced 
altimeter footprint that leads to a better spatial resolution. The added advantage of AltiKa is due 
to its enhanced bandwidth (500 MHz), which leads to higher vertical resolution. Thus, globally, an 
error budget improvement is expected. 
However, Ka-band has also drawbacks, mainly linked to its higher sensitivity to rainy and cloudy 
conditions. 
The altimeter antenna is a fixed offset paraboloid (1 meter diameter) and directed toward nadir of 
the satellite. It will be located on the top of the satellite. 
 
 
Figure 4 : SARAL/AltiKa Instrument 
2.6.2.2.  Dual frequency microwave radiometer 
The bi-frequency (23.8 GHz / 37 GHz) radiometer is used to correct altimetry measurements from 
wet troposphere crossing effects. The 23.8 GHz channel is the primary water vapor sensing channel, 
meaning higher water vapor concentrations will lead to larger 23.8 GHz brightness temperature 
values. The addition of the 37 GHz channel, which has less sensitivity to water vapor, facilitate the 
removal of the contributions from cloud liquid water, which also act to increase the 23.8 GHz 
brightness temperature. 
The antenna, shared with the altimeter, is fed by a two frequency coaxial corrugated horn feed. 
A corrugated cold sky horn is used for the gain calibration of the 2 radiometer channels.

2.6.2.3. DORIS System 
The complete DORIS system includes the DORIS on board package, a network of approximately 60 
beacons located around the world and a ground system. 
The on board package includes the electronic box hosting the receiver itself and the ultra stable 
oscillator and an omnidirectional antenna. 
The DORIS on board package is of the same version than the one embarked on SARAL/ALTIKA. It 
includes a 7-beacon receiving capability and an on-board real time function (DIODE for « 
Détermination Immédiate d’Orbite par DORIS Embarqué ») to compute the orbit ephemeris in real 
time. 
The DORIS on board package is dual string (in cold redundancy), each DORIS chain is automatically 
connected to the single antenna through a switching box inside the DORIS unit . Each receiver is 
connected to its own ultra-stable oscillator. 
The DORIS antenna is located on the Earth panel of the satellite.

2.6.2.4. Laser Reflector Array (LRA) 
It is used for precise calibration of other POD instruments, through analysis of laser shots from the 
ground then reflected by the LRA mirrors. 
The laser reflector array is placed on the nadir face of the satellite. It consists of several quartz 
corner cubes arrayed as a truncated cone with one in the center and the others distributed 
azimuthally around the cone. 
The LRA is provided by CNES.

is located at Cape Senetosa on the island of Corsica (8º48' E, 41º34' N, ascending pass 85).  
A satellite orbit slowly decays due to air drag, and has long-period variability because of the 
inhomogeneous gravity field of Earth, solar radiation pressure, and smaller forces. Periodic

maneuvers are required to keep the satellite in its orbit. The frequency of maneuvers depends 
primarily on the solar flux as it affects the Earth's atmosphere, and there are expected to be one 
maneuver (or series of maneuvers) every 15 to 30 days.  
Each orbit maintenance maneuver is performed using only one thrust to minimize impacts on the 
ground orbit solution. Orbit computation is optimized to minimize the orbit error during such 
periods. Science data are taken during orbit maintenance maneuvers and are distributed (an orbit 
state flag is provided in the products).

2.6.4. The SARAL/AltiKa Project Phases 
The satellite mission has two main phases (verification and operational).   
 
SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook

Figure 12 : SARAL Mission Phases and associated responsibilities 
2.6.4.1. The verification phase 
The verification phase (9 -10 months since beginning of cycle 1) began shortly after launch, when 
the satellite reached the operational (nominal repetitive) orbit and the satellite and sensor systems 
were functioning normally. This phase continued until the data received from the sensors were 
satisfactorily calibrated and verified.  
During this calibration/validation phase, the quality control will be achieved through many steps as 
a series of quality controls designed to ensure a continuous supply of data : regular cyclic data 
product analysis (complete parameter analysis and diagnostics, missions/edited measurements, 
crossovers and along-track analysis, orbit analysis, …), cross-calibration with other altimeters 
(SARAL/AltiKa,…), instrumental expertise for altimeter and radiometer monitoring, and by 
performing absolute calibration at dedicated in situ calibration sites. 
This verification phase is divided in 2 phases which overlap:  
1. One dedicated to the validation of the near real time products (OGDRs).  
2. The second phase dedicated to the validation of the off-line products (IGDR and GDR).  
2.6.4.2. The operational (routine and long-term CALVAL activities) 
The operational phase begins after the successful validation of each product type, and when all 
necessary algorithm and processing changes are implemented to have SARAL/AltiKa performances 
at the same level as other altimetric satellites. Beyond the CALVAL phase, it is necessary to 
perform regular long-term CALVAL in order to monitor biases and drifts of AltiKa overall system: in 
addition to previously mentioned analysis, comparison of SARAL/AltiKa data with global and 
regional networks of in situ data (tide gauges, T/S profiles, …) will be performed as soon as enough 
in situ data are available (~1 year after launch). These different analysis will also be implemented  
in order to calibrate and validate new ground processing algorithms that could be proposed and 
implemented during the CALVAL phase.

Considering the specificities of SARAL/AltiKa mission, particular attention will be given to evaluate 
and monitor the mission performances over coastal and inland water areas, over polar oceans and 
ice surfaces, as well as under rainy/cloudy conditions, with respect to previous and other in-flight 
altimetry missions. 
2.7. Data Processing and Distribution 
Processing centers perform functions such as science data processing, data verification and orbit 
determination. 
There are three levels of processed data: 
• 
Telemetry data (raw data or level0) 
• 
Sensor Data Records (engineering units or level1) 
• 
Geophysical Data Records (geophysical units or level2) 
There are two kinds of data processing and distribution: 
• 
Real-time processing and distribution (EUMETSAT and ISRO/NRSC) 
The operational geophysical data record (OGDR) is available with a latency of 3-5 hours. Note 
that this is a non-validated product that uses orbits computed by the on-board DORIS Navigator 
(DIODE) and that does not contain all the environmental/geophysical corrections.  
• 
Delayed-mode processing and distribution (CNES and ISRO/SAC) 
The interim geophysical data record (IGDR) is available per pass with a latency of less than 1.5 
days. Note that this is not a fully validated product, although it uses a preliminary orbit and 
includes all the environmental/geophysical corrections (preliminary for some of them). This 
product is generated by CNES only. 
The geophysical data record (GDR) is a fully validated product that uses a precise orbit and the 
best environmental/geophysical corrections. This product is available per repeat cycle with a 
latency of 40 days. Validation is performed by CNES teams to ensure in depth validation. GDR 
products are generated both by CNES and ISRO/SAC. 
Geophysical data records are disseminated to users as they become available, as well as ingested in 
two main archives (at CNES and ISRO), where they are made available to the scientific community, 
ISRO being in charge of data dissemination to Indian community and CNES to the rest of the 
scientific community. 
The NRT and offline data are provided through different sources and means as discussed below. 
Note that the telemetry acquisition strategy, designed to minimize the risk of science data loss, 
sometimes results in files containing data which overlaps in time. The NRT ground processing does 
not remove these overlaps, so it is possible to encounter two or more OGDR products which have 
overlapping start and stop sensing times. CNES-EUMETSAT-ISRO centers are disseminating 
SARAL/AltiKa products according to the interagency agreement.  
• 
CNES via AVISO data service: http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com 
“Archiving, Validation and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic data” is the French multi-
satellite data distribution center dedicated to space oceanography, developed by CNES. 
 
AVISO distributes and archives SARAL/AltiKa delayed-time data (IGDR, GDR). 
• 
EUMETSAT: http://www.eumetsat.int 
EUMETSAT is the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites. Its role 
is to deliver weather and climate-related satellite data, images and products– 24 hours a day, 
365 days a year.

EUMETSAT distributes operational data (OGDR). 
• 
ISRO: http://www.isro.org/  
The objective of ISRO is to develop space technology and its application to various national 
tasks.  
 
 
ISRO distributes (at national level) operational data (OGDR) and archives delayed-time data 
(GDR). 
2.7.1. Access to NRT data 
The OGDR and OGDR-SSHA files are produced at ISRO and EUMETSAT.  
Telemetry data downlinked to CNES’s polar X-band ground stations at Kiruna (Sweden) and Inuvik 
(Canada) are used to produce OGDR products.  
In near real time, ISRO disseminates the complete set of OGDR files via ftp and EUMETSAT 
disseminates the complete set of OGDR files on EUMETCast. The complete set of OGDR files consists 
of OGDR and OGDR-SSHA. 
Details on data dissemination services from ISRO and EUMETSAT agencies are described below. 
2.7.2. Access to off-line data 
The IGDR families are produced solely by CNES while GDR families are produced by CNES and ISRO. 
They 
are 
available 
for 
French 
and 
foreign 
users 
on 
the 
AVISO 
ftp 
server 
(http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com). For Indian users, off line GDR products are available on MOSDAC 
(http://www.mosdac.gov.in/login.jsp).  Both of these archival facilities also provide a variety of 
auxiliary files used to produce the O/I/GDR datasets, and ISRO also provides the OGDR family of 
datasets. 
Data dissemination services from ISRO and CNES agencies are described below. 
2.7.3. Documentation and Sample Reader Software 
This SARAL/AltiKa User’s Handbook document describes only the native product format. A 
description of the O/I/GDR product format and contents is provided in the CNES document “SALP-
ST-M-EA-15839-CN: SALP Products Specification - Volume 20 : AltiKa / SARAL User Products” (see RD 
4). All documents are available through the data dissemination services. 
Tools such as sample reading routines in Fortran-90, C, and IDL are also available through the data 
dissemination services on the AVISO website and on the ISRO website (TBC by ISRO). The toolbox 
BRAT is also recommended to read and study AltiKa data (see 6.4.3).

2.9. Access to data via EUMETSAT 
2.9.1. NRT data access  
Operational users requiring near real-time access (within a few hours of acquisition) can receive 
data via EUMETCast, which is the prime dissemination mechanism for EUMETSAT satellite data and 
meteorological products. EUMETCast is also used to deliver data supplied by several external data 
providers. 
EUMETCast is an environmental data and product dissemination system based on standard Digital 
Video Broadcast (DVB) technology. It uses commercial telecommunication geostationary satellites 
to broadcast data and products to a wide user community. EUMETSAT operates three EUMETCast 
broadcasts: EUMETCast Europe in Ku-band via Hotbird-6 EUMETCast Africa in C-band via 
AtlanticBird-3 and EUMETCast South America in C-band via NewSkies-806. The coverage zones of 
these broadcasts are shown in Figure below. The SARAL/AltiKa products are currently disseminated 
over all beams. 
 
 
 
Figure 11 : GEONETCast Coverage Zones 
 
EUMETCast is part of a wider data dissemination cooperation network known as GEONETCast, 
defined as a global network of satellite based data dissemination systems providing environmental 
data to a world-wide user community. The current partners within the GEONETCast initiative 
include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the World Meteorological 
Organization (WMO) and EUMETSAT, as well as many prospective data provider partners.  
EUMETCast is a multi-service dissemination mechanism and other environmental data streams and 
products are also delivered via EUMETCast : 
• 
Space-based observations from the Meteosat, Metop, GOES, MT-SAT and FY2 satellites – at 
their most frequent, these data are delivered to Users within 5-minutes of processing 
• 
MODIS level 1and 2 products covering selective geographical regions 
• 
Numerical Weather Forecasts 
•

EUMETCast has an installed user base of over 2500 stations worldwide. 
A typical EUMETCast reception station comprises a standard PC with DVB card inserted and a 
satellite off-set antenna fitted with a digital universal V/H LNB. All components of the reception 
station are commercially available. The hardware costs for a single PC station for EUMETCast 
Europe (Ku-band) reception start at around €1,500. In addition, EUMETCast Client Software package 
is required for handling the incoming DVB and storing it as data files. This package is available

3. Product evolution history 
3.1. Models and Standards History 
The version of the data produced during the Cal/Val phase of the mission is identified by the 
version letter “T” in the name of the data products. This “T” calibration/validation version will be 
extensively validated by PIs during the verification phase. 
The current product version adopts models and standards that are consistent with version “d” of 
the Jason-1 and Jason-2 (I)GDR products (see RD 1).  
The table below summarizes the models and standards that are adopted in this version of the 
SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDRs.

Geometrical analysis of the altimeter waveforms, which retrieves the 
following parameters: 
-

-

“Ice 2” retracking 
The aim of the ice2 retracking algorithm is to make the measured 
waveform coincide with a return power model, according to Least 
Square estimators. Retrieval of the following parameters: 
- 
Epoch ⇒ altimeter range 
- 
Width of the leading edge 
- 
Amplitude ⇒ Sigma0 
- 
Slope of the logarithm of the waveform at the trailing edge ⇒ 
Mispointing angle 
- 
the thermal noise level (to be removed from the waveform 
samples) 
 
“Sea Ice” retracking 
In this algorithm, waveform parameterisation based on peak threshold 
retracking is applied to the Ka-band waveform. From this 
parameterisation, a tracking offset and backscatter estimate are 
determined. Tests are made on the extent of the tracking offset, and 
extreme values are flagged as retracking failures. The sea-ice 
waveform amplitude is determined by finding the maximum value of 
the waveform samples and the tracking offset is determined by 
finding the point on the waveform (by interpolation) where the 
waveform amplitude exceeds a threshold determined from the above 
sea-ice amplitude. A tracking offset is determined. The Centre Of 
Gravity offset correction must be included in the range measurement 
as the correction is not available separately in the L2 product.

3.2.4. Geoid 
SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDRs use the EGM96 geopotential to compute the geoid [Lemoine et al., 1998]. 
The EGM96 geopotential model has been used to calculate point values of geoid undulation on a 
0.25 x 0.25 degree grid that spans the latitude range +85.0 deg. to -85.0 deg. The EGM96 model is 
complete to spherical harmonic degree and order 360, and has been corrected appropriately so as 
 
SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  
 
Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 
43 
 
 
 
to refer to the mean tide system as far as the permanent tide is concerned [Rapp et al., 1991]. The 
k2 Love number used in this conversion was 0.3. The geoid undulations are given with respect to an 
ideal geocentric mean Earth ellipsoid, whose semi-major axis remains undefined (i.e., there is no 
zero-degree term in the spherical harmonic series of these geoid undulations). The flattening of this 
reference ellipsoid is f=1/298.257 so that values are consistent with constants adopted for T/P. 
Since the geoid undulations have been computed from an expansion to degree 360, the resolution of 
the undulations will be on the order of 50km. Data used to derived the EGM96 model include 
surface gravity data from different regions of the globe, altimeter derived gravity anomalies from 
the GEOSAT Geodetic Mission, altimeter derived anomalies from ERS-1, direct satellite altimetry 
from T/P, ERS-1 and GEOSAT, and satellite tracking to over 20 satellites using satellite laser 
ranging, GPS, DORIS, the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS), and TRANET. 
 
Figure 15 : EGM96 geoid 
More information on EGM96 can be found at http://cddisa.gsfc.nasa.gov/926/egm96/egm96.html 
3.2.5. Bathymetry 
The value of this parameter is determined from the DTM2000.1 model from N. Pavlis and J. Saleh 
[personal communication, 2000] of the Raytheon ITSS/Goddard Space Flight Center. The model is 
provided globally with a 2' resolution. The heritage of DTM2000.1 goes back to the OSUJAN98 
database [Pavlis and Rapp, 1990] and the JGP95E database [Chapter 2 of Lemoine et al., 1998]. The 
bathymetric information in DTM2000.1 (originating from Smith and Sandwell's [1994] global sea 
floor topography) has significant differences with the ETOPO5 bathymetric model. The mean and 
standard deviation of these differences is 10 m and 270 m, respectively. 
 
3.2.6. Ocean Tides 
The two geocentric tide values provided on the SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR, ocean_tide_sol1 and 
ocean_tide_sol2, are computed with diurnal and semidiurnal ocean and load tide values predicted 
by the GOT4.8 and FES2004 models, respectively.  
Both geocentric ocean tide fields (ocean_tide_sol1 and ocean_tide_sol2) also include the load tides 
from the respective models (load_tide_sol1 and load_tide_sol2), and the equilibrium long-period 
ocean tide (ocean_tide_equil). These two fields (ocean_tide_sol1 and ocean_tide_sol2) also include 
the S1 oceanic response to atmospheric pressure based on the model from Ray and Egbert (2004). 
The FES2004 model also includes the M4 ocean tide. Note that the load tide fields (load_tide_sol1 
and load_tide_sol2) only include the load tides from the GOT4.8 and FES2004 models, and do not 
contain the load tides from the S1, M4, or equilibrium long-period ocean tides. 
Both models are interpolated to provide the geocentric ocean and load tides at the location of the 
altimeter measurement, and an interpolation quality flag is provided on the (O)(I)GDRs to indicate 
the quality of this interpolation (see interp_flag_ocean_tide_sol1 and interp_flag_ocean_tide_sol2).

3.2.6.1. GOT4.8 Ocean Tide Model  
Solution GOT4.8 [Ray 1999; Ray, personnal communication], is the last version of GOT models 
developped by R. Ray. 
This model is identical to 4.7 in all constituents save S2. 
GOT4.7 used the following data: 
• 
364 cycles of T/P 
• 
114 cycles of T/P on the interlaced orbit 
• 
117 cycles of ERS1 and ERS2 
• 
126 cycles of GFO 
None Jason data has been used in this solution. 
 
The solution consists of independent near-global estimates of 10 constituents (K1, K2, M2, M4, N2, 
O1, P1, Q1, S1, S2) . An a priori model was used that consisted of the hydrodynamic model FES 2004 
[Lyard et al. 2006], and several other local hydrodynamic models, GOT4.8 implement the fixed-up 
dry troposphere correction for TP where the air tide wasn't being handled correctly (whereas it is in 
Jason GDRs), and this affects S2 mostly.  
Another difference between GOT4.7 and GOT4.8 is that 4.7 had not applied the TP Cg correction, 
while 4.8 did use the Cg.

3.2.6.2. FES2004 Ocean Tide Model  
The FES2004 model is a finite-element hydrodynamic model, constrained with tide gage and past 
altimeter data [Le Provost, 2001] (see ocean_tide_sol2). 
It is based on the resolution of the tidal barotropic equations on a global finite element grid 
without any open boundary condition, which leads to solutions independent of in situ data (no open 
boundary conditions and no data assimilation). FES2004 is the last update of the FES solution. Tide 
gages and reprocessed TP and ERS crossover data are assimilated in the FES2002 hydrodynamical 
solution. The altimeter data reprocessing consists in a new atmospherical forcing response 
correction (Mog2D-G) applied to the data before the harmonic analysis. FES2004 includes the M2, 
S2, N2, K2, 2N2, K1, O1, P1, Q1 tides. Four hydrodynamical long period tides and the non-linear M4 
tide are also included in the distribution package. A new prediction algorithm is associated with 
FES2004. This algorithm use an admittance method to extends the prediction spectrum up to 36 
tidal constituents. The FES2004 model also provides non-equilibrium models for the Mm, Mf, Mtm, 
and Msqm tidal components, which are provided by parameter ocean_tide_non_equil.

3.2.7. Sea Surface Height Bias Recommendation  
The estimate of the absolute bias in the SARAL/AltiKa sea-surface height measurements (SSH) is one 
of the goals of the Cal/Val phase and is therefore not fully consolidated at this time.  
The Sea State Bias (SSB) can be defined as the difference between the apparent sea level as “seen” 
by the altimeter and the actual mean sea level. It is composed of : the Electromagnetic bias (EMB), 
and skewness and tracker biases that affect the accuracy of altimeter measurements and are all 
dependent on SWH. The EMB (main contributor) results from the fact that the radar senses an 
average sea surface lower than the true average sea surface, due to amplification from wave 
troughs. This bias can be expressed as a percentage of SWH, with the percentage being a complex 
function of the sea-surface slope and elevation statistical distribution.  
As a first guess, we assume that the SSB value is 3.5% of SWH. A consolidated SSB solution will be 
computed about one year after launch, to interpolate the SSB value bilinearly from a table 
(empirical model derived from analyses of the altimeter data) as a function of SWH and wind speed.  
It should be noted that the bias reflects the combination of the mean errors from all of the 
corrections that are used to compute sea surface height. 
We expect very good SARAL/AltiKa data quality. However, some particular contributors have 
unknown or hard to estimate error contributions, simply because SARAL/AltiKa mission is so 
innovative (Ka-band altimeter) that a lack of information and experience prevents us to get a 
precise pre-launch error estimation: this is the case for “sea state bias correction”, “ionosphere 
correction for OGDR”, and “wind speed” error estimations.

4. Using the (O)(I)GDR data 
4.1. Overview 
This section gives the reader a guide to the use of the SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR data. While this 
handbook tries to be correct and complete, note that nothing can replace the information to be 
gained at conferences and other meetings from those using these data. The reader must proceed 
with caution and at his or her own risk. Further information is also available on the web servers 
provided in Annex C, please direct questions and comments to the contacts given there.  
The instruments on SARAL/AltiKa make direct observations of the following quantities: altimeter 
range, ocean significant wave height, ocean radar backscatter cross-section (a measure of wind 
speed) and tropospheric water content. Ground based laser station and DORIS station 
measurements of the satellite location and speeds are used in precision orbit determination (POD). 
The DORIS stations also measure the ionospheric electron content along the line of sight to the 
satellite. All of these measurements are useful in themselves, but they are made primarily to derive 
the sea surface height with the highest possible accuracy. Such a computation also needs external 
data (not collected aboard SARAL/AltiKa), e.g., atmospheric pressure, etc. In addition, instrument 
health and calibration data are collected onboard and used to make corrections to the main 
measurements and to monitor the instrument stability in the long term.  
This (O)(I)GDR contains all relevant corrections needed to calculate the sea surface height. For the 
other "geophysical variables" in the (O)(I)GDR: ocean significant wave height, tropospheric water 
content and wind speed, the needed instrument and atmospheric corrections have already been 
applied.  
The following sections explain the rationale for how the corrections should be applied.  
4.2. Typical computation from altimetry data 
In this section references are made to specific (O)(I)GDR parameters by name using the name of the 
variable as described in the NetCDF data sets.  
WARNING 
Default values are given to data when computed values are not available (See section 6.1.2.4) 
so you must screen parameters to avoid using those with default values. Also you must check 
flag values. The related flags are given in the description of each variable (See section 6.1.2.4) 
although some discussion of flags appears in this section.  
4.2.1. Corrected Altimeter Range 
The main data of the (O)(I)GDR are the altimeter ranges. The (O)(I)GDR provides ranges measured 
at Ka band. The given range is corrected for instrumental effects (net_instr_corr_range_ka). The 
given range must be corrected for path delay in the atmosphere through which the radar pulse 
passes and the nature of the reflecting sea surface. All range corrections are defined and they 
should be ADDED to the range. The corrected (Ka band) range is given by : 
Corrected Range = Range  + Wet Troposphere Correction  
 
+ Dry Troposphere Correction  
 
+ Ionosphere Correction  
 
+ Sea State Bias Correction 
Wet Troposphere Correction :

Use radiometer correction (rad_wet_tropo_corr). 
Dry Troposphere Correction :  
Use model correction (model_dry_tropo_corr).  
Ionosphere Correction :  
Use model ionosphere correction (iono_corr_gim). 
Sea State Bias Correction : 
Use sea state bias correction (sea_state_bias). 
4.2.2. Sea Surface Height and Sea Level Anomaly 
Sea surface height (SSH) is the height of the sea surface above the reference ellipsoid. It is 
calculated by subtracting the corrected range from the Altitude:  
Sea Surface Height = Altitude - Corrected Range 
 
The sea level anomaly (SLA), also referred to as Residual Sea Surface, is defined here as the sea 
surface height minus the mean sea surface and minus known geophysical effects, namely tidal and 
inverse barometer. It is given by:  
Sea Level Anomaly = Sea Surface Height  
 
- Mean Sea Surface 
 
- Solid Earth Tide Height  
 
- Geocentric Ocean Tide Height  
 
- Pole Tide Height  
 
- Inverted Barometer Height Correction  
 
- HF Fluctuations of the Sea Surface Topography 
 
The SLA contains information about: 
· 
Real changes in ocean topography related to ocean currents  
· 
Dynamic response to atmospheric pressure 
· 
Differences between tides and the tide models  
· 
Differences between the mean sea surface model and the true mean sea surface at the 
SARAL/AltiKa location  
· 
Unmodeled or mismodeled measurement effects (skewness, sea state bias, altimeter errors, 
tropospheric corrections, ionospheric correction, etc.)  
· 
Orbit errors  
There is naturally also random measurement noise. Understanding the first four items as a function 
of space and time is the purpose of SARAL/AltiKa.

Use inv_bar_corr (see also section 5.10). 
HF Fluctuations of the Sea Surface Topography : 
Use hf_fluctuations_corr (see also section 5.10). 
Mean Sea Surface : 
See sections 4.2.2.2 and 5.4.  
4.2.2.1. Tide Effects 
The total tide effect on the sea surface height is the sum of three values from the (O)(I)GDR:  
Tide Effect = Geocentric Ocean Tide + Solid Earth Tide + Pole Tide  
(See also section 5.9 and subsections)  
Geocentric Ocean Tide : 
The geocentric ocean tide provided on the (O)(I)GDR is actually the sum total of the ocean tide 
with respect to the ocean bottom, and the loading tide height of the ocean bottom.  
Geocentric Ocean Tide = Ocean Tide + Load Tide 
The (O)(I)GDR provides a choice of two geocentric ocean tide values, ocean_tide_sol1 and 
ocean_tide_sol2. Each uses a different model for the sum total of the ocean tide and loading tide 
heights from the diurnal and semidiurnal tides, but both include an equilibrium representation of 
the long-period ocean tides at all periods except for the zero frequency (permanent tide) term. 
Note that the (O)(I)GDR also explicitly provides the loading tide height from each of the two models 
that are used to determine the two geocentric ocean tide values, load_tide_sol1, load_tide_sol2. 
Obviously, the geocentric ocean tide values and loading tide values should not be used 
simultaneously, since the loading tide height would be modeled twice. 
Solid Earth Tide : 
Use solid_earth_tide 
NOTE: Zero frequency (permanent tide) term also not included in this parameter. 
Pole Tide : 
Use pole_tide  
The tide values all have the same sign/sense in that positive numbers indicate that the surface is 
farther from the center of the Earth.  
4.2.2.2. Geophysical Surface - Mean Sea Surface or Geoid 
The geophysical fields Geoid (geoid) - actually geoid undulation, but called simply geoid - and Mean 
Sea Surface (mean_sea_surface) are distances above the reference ellipsoid, as is the Sea Surface 
Height. These values are for the location indicated by latitude and longitude. If the values of these 
fields are needed at a different location within the current frame, along-track interpolation may be 
done using the high rate (40/second) range and altitude values.  
As the geoid is derived from the mean sea surface, the latter is the better-known quantity. The 
residual surface with respect to the geoid is sometimes called the "dynamic topography" of the 
ocean surface.  
See also discussions of mean sea surface and geoid in sections 5.3 and 5.4.

4.2.3. Mean Sea Surface and Adjustment of the Cross Track Gradient 
In order to study sea level changes between two dates, it is necessary to difference sea surface 
heights from different cycles at the exact same latitude-longitude, so that the not well-known 
time-invariant geoid cancels out. However, the (O)(I)GDR samples are not given at the same 
latitude-longitude on different cycles. They are given approximately every 1 sec along the pass 
(about 6 km, the time difference and distance vary slightly with satellite height above the surface), 
and the satellite ground track is allowed to drift by +1 km. This introduces a problem: on different 
cycles the satellite will sample a different geoid profile. This effect is the so-called cross-track 
geoid gradient, and Brenner and Koblinsky [1990] estimated it at about 2 cm/km over most of the 
ocean, larger over continental slopes, reaching 20 cm/km at trenches. Even if the passes repeated 
exactly, one would have to interpolate along the pass (say, to a fixed set of latitudes) because a 3 
km mismatch in along pass position would cause approximately a 6 cm difference in the geoid, 
which would mistakenly be interpreted as a change in oceanographic conditions.  
Both problems are simultaneously solved if the quantity one interpolates along a given pass is the 
difference : 
Residual Height – Mean Sea Surface  
Then the real geoid changes across the track are automatically accounted for (to the extent the 
MSS model is close to the true geoid) because the MSS is spatially interpolated to the actual 
satellite latitude-longitude in the (O)(I)GDR. The residual height term above is the residual sea 
surface height after applying all the tidal, atmospheric and ionospheric corrections, etc. Otherwise, 
those need to be interpolated separately.  
One possible approach is to interpolate along track to a set of common points, a "reference" track. 
The reference could be: 
· 
An actual pass with maximum data and/or minimum gaps, or  
· 
A specially constructed fixed track (see below).  
The procedure is the following: 
· 
For each common point, find neighboring points in the pass of interest (POI).  
· 
In the POI, interpolate along track to the common point, using longitude as the independent 
variable, for each quantity of interest - sea surface height (see above), mean sea surface, 
geoid, tides, etc.  
· 
As stated above, the quantity to compare at each common point is :  
ΔSSH = Interpolated POI SSH - Interpolated POI MSS  
· 
Other geophysical corrections must be applied to ΔSSH, depending on the type of 
investigation  
The geoid model in the (O)(I)GDR could substitute the MSS model, but its use will result in reduced 
accuracy in the interpolation because the resolution of the geoid undulation is lower than that of 
the MSS.  
Desirable features of a fixed reference track include:  
· 
Equal spacing of points (good for FFT)  
· 
Independent variable = (point longitude - pass equator crossing longitude)  
· 
Equator is a point (simplifies calculation)  
· 
Point density similar to original data density 
With these specifications, it is possible to make only two fixed tracks, one ascending and one 
descending, which will serve for all passes. The template pass is then shifted by the equator

crossing longitude (global attribute of the product, see 6.2) of each pass. Recall that the equator 
longitude is from a predicted orbit (not updated during GDR processing). Improved accuracy can be 
obtained by interpolating in the latitude, longitude values. When one interpolates to the reference 
track, it is good practice to check that the interpolated latitude from the data records used is close 
to the latitude on the reference track.  
4.2.4. Range Compression 
Each 1Hz frame of the AltiKa Ka band range measurement (see range parameter) is derived from 
the linear regression of the respective valid 40 Hz range measurements (see range_40hz 
parameter).  
An iterative outlier detection scheme is adopted in this linear regression and the resulting 40 Hz 
measurements are identified by setting the corresponding bit in the parameters (range_used_40hz) 
to 1. Measurements not considered as outliers have the parameters (range_used_40hz) set to 0. 
The number of valid 40 Hz measurements that are used to derive each of the 1 Hz measurements is 
provided on the (O)(I)GDRs (see range_numval parameter), as are the root-mean-square of the 
differences between the valid 40 Hz measurements and the derived 1 Hz measurement (see 
range_rms parameter). 
Specialized applications, such as over land, ice, lakes or rivers, may require that the users perform 
their own compression algorithm on the 40 Hz measurements.

5. Altimetric data 
This section presents a short discussion of the main quantities on the (O)(I)GDR.  
An excellent overview of the theoretical and practical effects of radar altimetry is the “Satellite 
Altimetry” Chapter by Chelton et al [2001].  
5.1. Precise Orbits 
CNES has the responsibility for producing the orbit ephemeris for the SARAL/AltiKa data products. 
The SARAL/AltiKa OGDRs provide a navigator orbit that has radial accuracies better than 30 cm 
(rms), the IGDRs provide a preliminary orbit that has radial accuracies better than 4 cm (rms), 
while the GDRs provide a precise orbit that has radial accuracies better than 3 cm (rms). 
5.2. Altimeter Range 
An altimeter operates by sending out a short pulse of radiation and measuring the time required for 
the pulse to return from the sea surface. This measurement, called the altimeter range, gives the 
distance between the instrument and the sea surface, provided that the velocity of the propagation 
of the pulse and the precise arrival time are known. The mono frequency altimeter on SARAL/AltiKa 
performs only range measurements at Ka band frequencies (see range parameter).  
The range reported on the SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR has already been corrected for a variety of 
calibration and instrument effects, including calibration errors, pointing angle errors, center of 
gravity motion, and terms related to the altimeter acceleration such as Doppler shift and oscillator 
drift. The sum total of these corrections also appears on the (O)(I)GDR for Ka band range (see 
net_instr_corr_range parameter).  
5.3. Geoid 
The geoid is an equipotential surface of the Earth's gravity field that is closely associated with the 
location of the mean sea surface. The reference ellipsoid is a bi-axial ellipsoid of revolution. The 
center of the ellipsoid is ideally at the center of mass of the Earth although the center is usually 
placed at the origin of the reference frame in which a satellite orbit is calculated and tracking 
station positions given. The separation between the geoid and the reference ellipsoid is the geoid 
undulation (see geoid parameter).  
The geoid undulation, over the entire Earth, has a root mean square value of 30.6 m with extreme 
values of approximately 83 m and -106 m. Although the geoid undulations are primarily long 
wavelength phenomena, short wavelength changes in the geoid undulation are seen over 
seamounts, trenches, ridges, etc., in the oceans. The calculation of a high resolution geoid requires 
high resolution surface gravity data in the region of interest as well as a potential coefficient model 
that can be used to define the long and medium wavelengths of the Earth's gravitational field. 
Surface gravity data are generally only available in certain regions of the Earth and spherical 
harmonic expansions of the Earth's gravitational potential are usually used to define the geoid 
globally. Currently, such expansions are available to degree 360 and in some cases higher.  
For ocean circulation studies, it is important that the long wavelength part of the geoid be 
accurately determined.

5.4. Mean Sea Surface 
A Mean Sea Surface (MSS) represents the position of the ocean surface averaged over an appropriate 
time period to remove annual, semi-annual, seasonal, and spurious sea surface height signals. A MSS 
is given as a grid with spacing consistent with the altimeter and other data used in the generation 
of the grid values. The MSS grid can be useful for data editing purposes, for the calculation of along 
track and cross track geoid gradients, for the calculation of gridded gravity anomalies, for 
geophysical studies, for a reference surface to which sea surface height data from different 
altimeter missions can be reduced, etc. The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides a global MSS model 
that is generated from multiple satellite altimetry missions (see mean_sea_surface parameter). 
Longer time spans of data that become available in the future, along with improved data handling 
techniques will improve the current MSS models. Care must be given to the retention of high 
frequency signal and the reduction of high frequency noise.  
5.5. Mean Dynamic Topography 
A Mean Dynamic Topography (MDT) represents the Mean Sea Surface referenced to a geoid and 
corrected from geophysical effects. A MDT is given as a grid with spacing consistent with the 
altimeter and other data used in the generation of the grid values. The MDT provides the absolute 
reference surface for the ocean circulation. The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides a global MDT 
model (see mean_topography parameter) that is a combined product recovering several years based 
on GRACE mission, altimetry and in situ data (hydrologic and drifters data). 
5.6. Geophysical Corrections 
The atmosphere and ionosphere slow the velocity of radio pulses at a rate proportional to the total 
mass of the atmosphere, the mass of water vapor in the atmosphere, and the number of free 
electrons in the ionosphere. In addition, radio pulses do not reflect from the mean sea level but 
from a level that depends on wave height and wind speed. The errors due to these processes cannot 
be ignored and must be removed. Discussions of these effects are given in Chelton et al. [2001].  
5.6.1. Dry Troposphere  
The propagation velocity of a radio pulse is slowed by the "dry" gases and the quantity of water 
vapor in the Earth's troposphere. The "dry" gas contribution is nearly constant and produces height 
errors of approximately -2.3 m. The water vapor in the troposphere is quite variable and 
unpredictable and produces a height calculation error of -6 cm to -40 cm. However, these effects 
can be measured or modeled as discussed below.  
The gases in the troposphere contribute to the index of refraction. In detail, the refractive index 
depends on pressure and temperature. When hydrostatic equilibrium and the ideal gas law are 
assumed, the vertically integrated range delay is a function only of the surface pressure, see 
Chelton et al. [2001]. The dry meteorological tropospheric range correction is principally equal to 
the surface pressure multiplied by -2.277mm/mbar, with a small adjustment also necessary to 
reflect a small latitude dependence (see model_dry_tropo_corr parameter).

where Patm is surface atmospheric pressure in mbar, phi is latitude, and model_dry_tropo_corr is 
the dry troposphere correction in mm. There is no straightforward way of measuring the nadir 
surface pressure from a satellite, so it is determined from the European Center for Medium Range 
Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) numerical weather prediction model using the surface pressure

fields. For OGDR processing, predicted ECMWF Psurf fields are used and for (I)GDR processing 
analyzed fields are used.  
5.6.2. Wet Troposphere 
The amount of water vapor present along the path length contributes to the index of refraction of 
the Earth's atmosphere. Its contribution to the delay of the radio pulse, the wet tropospheric delay, 
can be estimated by measuring the atmospheric brightness near the water vapor line at 22.2356 
GHz and providing suitable removal of the background. The SARAL/AltiKa dual frequency 
radiometer measures the brightness temperatures in the nadir path at 23.8 and 37.0 GHz: the water 
vapor signal is sensed by the 23.8 GHz channel, while the 37 GHz channel removes other 
atmospheric contributions (surface emission, cloud cover influence) [Keihm et al., 1995]. 
Measurements are combined to obtain the path delay in the satellite range measurement due to the 
water vapor content (see rad_wet_tropo_corr parameter).  
The ECMWF numerical weather prediction model provides also a value for the wet tropospheric 
delay. An interpolated value from this model is included in the (O)(I)GDR, as a backup to the 
measurement from the radiometer (see model_wet_tropo_corr parameter). This backup will prove 
useful when sun glint, land contamination, or anomalous sensor behavior makes the radiometer 
measurement of the wet tropospheric delay unusable. 
The ECMWF meteorological fields are interpolated to provide the model dry and wet tropospheric 
corrections at the time and location of the altimeter measurement (see model_dry_tropo_corr and 
model_wet_tropo_corr) and an interpolation quality flag is provided on the (O)(I)GDR to indicate 
the quality of this interpolation (see interp_flag_meteo).  
5.6.3. Ionosphere 
The group velocity of the altimeter radar pulses is slowed by the presence of free electrons in the 
Earth’s ionospheric layer. As the Total Electronic Content (TEC) is highly variable in time (diurnal, 
seasonal, solar cycle variations) and in space (latitude dependent), accurate measurement of the 
resulting delay requires generally fine sampling coincident with the radar measurements. The 
ionospheric dispersion being linear, the delay is usually computed by combining the dual-frequency 
measurements of the radar altimeter (e.g. for T/P, Jason-1 and 2 : Ku and C bands).  
In the case of AltiKa, only one frequency is available (Ka), which prevents from using such a 
classical dual frequency approach. However, it is shown that ionosphere correction (= 40300 x TEC / 
frequency²) is an order of magnitude smaller in Ka-band than in Ku-band (actually divided by 7). For 
amplitudes of the ionosphere correction in Ku-band in the range 2-25 cm, equivalent effect in Ka-
band is only 0.3-3.6 cm.  
Thus, for AltiKa, external ancillary data are used to compute ionosphere correction, in the form of 
TEC grids computed from GPS-based observations and ionosphere model (the JPL Global Ionosphere 
Maps – GIM – model). Other auxiliary data such as solar activity coefficients (within IRI95) are used 
to correct the satellite altitude.

Figure 16. Example of Global Ionosphere Maps from JPL 
GIM model has been validated through comparisons with T/P, Jason-1, Jason-2 and ENVISAT dual 
frequency ionosphere corrections.  
As GIM fields are distributed with a 24 hours latency, the correct fields will not be available on time 
for OGDR processing. In that case, the last GIM field available will be used, as well as an 
extrapolated MOE orbit, in order to compute in advance the ionosphere correction for OGDR. 
The ionospheric GIM correction solution may be used over non ocean surfaces (ice, land, etc.). 
5.6.4. Ocean Waves (sea state bias) 
Unlike the preceding effects, sea-state effects are an intrinsic property of the large footprint radar 
measurements. The surface scattering elements do not contribute equally to the radar return; 
troughs of waves tend to reflect altimeter pulses better than do crests. Thus the centroid of the 
mean reflecting surface is shifted away from mean sea level towards the troughs of the waves. The 
shift, referred to as the electromagnetic (EM) bias, causes the altimeter to overestimate the range 
(see Rodriguez et al., [1992]). In addition, a skewness bias also exists from the assumption in the 
onboard algorithms that the probability density function of heights is symmetric, while in reality it 
is skewed. Finally, there is a tracker bias, which is a purely instrumental effect. The sum of EM 
bias, skewness bias, and tracker bias is called 'sea state bias' (see sea_state_bias parameter). 
The accuracy of sea state bias models remains limited and continues to be a topic of research. The 
current most accurate estimates are obtained using empirical models derived from analyses of the 
altimeter data. The sea state bias is computed from a bilinear interpolation of a table of sea state 
biases versus significant wave height and wind speed, based on empirical fits (Labroue [2004]). 
 
Nevertheless all these works are done for Ku and C band so at the beginning of the mission, the SSB 
will be estimated at 3.5% of SWH and an empirical model will be computed using at least one year 
of SARAL/AltiKa data.

5.7. Trailing edge variation flag 
5.7.1. Introduction : Rain & Cloud effect on SARAL/Altika 
Ka-band is highly sensitive to rainy and cloudy conditions. It means that an overall assessment of 
rain effect on SARAL/AltiKa data availability and quality should be performed during the 
verification phase in order to monitor global percentage and spatio-temporal evolution of lost data 
due to rain and cloud effect, and thus give a consolidated budget for data loss due to rain 
attenuation and waveform distortion.  
Attenuation by rain is expected to be much more significant at Ka-band than Ku-band, although 
even in the tropics, actual data loss is only expected to be 5-10% (Tournadre et al., 2009). 
However, the reliable detection and flagging of rain-contaminated data is important for the quality 
of the overall altimeter product. 
5.7.2. SARAL/AltiKa Trailing edge variation flag 
Due to the mono-frequency characteristic of the SARAL/AltiKa altimeter, the rain flags used for T/P 
and Jason-1&2 altimeters can not be used as they rely on the differential attenuation by rain of the 
signal at Ku and C band. Furthermore, the use of Ka band implies that not only rain can significantly 
alter the altimeter measurement but also dense cloud, that is why we prefer using “trailing edge 
variation effect” instead of “rain effect”.  
A new “trailing edge variation flag” based on the analysis of the along-track variation of the off-
nadir angle estimate (the so-called “Matching Pursuit” algorithm) has been defined and tested using 
Jason-1 data (Tournadre et al., 2009) and will be used operationally to detect the data potentially 
affected by atmospheric liquid water. This new approach to altimeter data rain flagging has to be 
validated and calibrated during the commissioning phase. 
5.7.3. Limitations 
Please note that the trailing_edge_variation_flag parameter should be used carefully. In fact, as 
mentioned above, this flag detects surfaces changes caused by rain, sigma-blooms, cloud, etc. The 
meaning of the flag is: non short scale variation/short scale variation. To be considered only as a 
rain flag users should correlate this flag with water vapor content or liquid water content (see 
rad_water_vapor and rad_liquid_water parameter). These auxiliary information come from the 
radiometer measurements. Thresholds for these auxiliary parameters should be defined and 
provided during commissioning phase. 
5.8. Ice Flag 
The range measurement from the altimeter is likely to have larger errors when the pulse is 
reflected off ice surfaces. The ice surface is not at sea level, but at some unknown distance above 
it. For this reason the SARAL/ALTIKA (O)(I)GDR provides an ice flag (see ice_flag parameter) to 
indicate when the data point is likely to be over ice. 
The ice flag is set if the absolute value of the difference between the model wet tropospheric 
correction and the dual frequency wet tropospheric correction retrieved from 23.8 GHz and 37.0 
GHz brightness temperatures exceeds a specified threshold, OR if the number of valid 40-Hz 
altimeter range of the processed measurement is smaller than a specified threshold. If the 
corresponding computations cannot be performed, then the ice flag is set if a climatological map 
predicts ice at the given location, and if the wind speed derived from the altimeter measurement is 
less than 1 m/s, i.e., the backscatter is larger than normally expected from the ocean.

Disclaimer: Users are advised to use this flag carefully because it is linked to conditions relative 
to altimeter wind speed (derived from sigma naught values). As it was not possible to assess 
precisely the sigma naught before launch, all derived parameters may not be representative 
and are subject to tuning at the beginning of the mission.   
5.9. Tides 
Tides are a significant contributor to the observed sea surface height [LeProvost, 2001]. While they 
are of interest in themselves, they have more variation than all other time-varying ocean signals. 
Since they are highly predictable, they are removed from the data in order to study ocean 
circulation.  
There are several contributions to the tidal effect: the ocean tide, the load tide, the solid earth 
tide and the pole tide. The ocean tide, load tide and solid earth tide are all related to luni-solar 
forcing of the earth, either directly as is the case of the ocean and solid earth tide, or indirectly as 
is the case with the load tide since it is forced by the ocean tide. The pole tide is due to variations 
in the earth’s rotation and is unrelated to luni-solar forcing.  
SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDRs do not explicitly provide values for the pure ocean tide, but instead 
provide values for a quantity referred to as the geocentric ocean tide, which is the sum total of the 
ocean tide and the load tide. Values of the load tide that were used to compute the geocentric 
ocean tide are also explicitly provided, so the pure ocean tide can be determined by subtracting 
the load tide value from the geocentric ocean tide value. Note that the permanent tide is not 
included in either the geocentric ocean tide or solid earth tide corrections that are provided on the 
SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDRs. 
5.9.1. Geocentric Ocean Tide 
As mentioned above, the geocentric ocean tide is a quantity sometimes used to refer to the sum 
total of the ocean tide and the load tide. The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides two choices for the 
geocentric ocean tide, ocean_tide_sol1 and ocean_tide_sol2, each of which is computed as the sum 
total of the diurnal and semidiurnal ocean and load tides as predicted by a particular model, and an 
equilibrium representation of the long-period ocean tides at all periods except for the zero 
frequency (constant) term. The two load tide values provided on the GDR, load_tide_sol1 and 
load_tide_sol2, provide the respective load tide values that were used to compute ocean_tide_sol1 
and ocean_tide_sol2. 
5.9.2. Long period Ocean Tide 
The long-period ocean tides are a subject of continuing investigation. To first order, they can be 
approximated by an equilibrium representation. However, the true long-period ocean tide response 
is thought to have departures from an equilibrium response that increase with decreasing period. 
The two principal long-period ocean tide components, Mf and Mm, with fortnightly and monthly 
periods respectively, are known to have departures from an equilibrium response with magnitudes 
less than 1-2 cm. 
The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR explicitly provides a value for an equilibrium representation of the 
long-period ocean tide that includes all long-period tidal components excluding the permanent tide 
(zero frequency) component (see parameter ocean_tide_equil). Note that both geocentric ocean 
tide values on the (O)(I)GDR (ocean_tide_sol1 and ocean_tide_sol2) already include the equilibrium 
long-period ocean tide and should therefore not be used simultaneously. 
 
The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides a parameter for a non-equilibrium representation of the long-
period ocean tides (see parameter ocean_tide_non_equil). This parameter is provided as a 
correction to the equilibrium long-period ocean tide model so that the total non-equilibrium long 
period ocean tide is formed as a sum of ocean_tide_equil and ocean_tide_non_equil.

5.9.3. Solid Earth Tide 
The solid Earth responds to external gravitational forces similarly to the oceans. The response of 
the Earth is fast enough that it can be considered to be in equilibrium with the tide generating 
forces. Then, the surface is parallel with the equipotential surface, and the tide height is 
proportional to the potential. The two proportionality constants are the so-called Love numbers. It 
should be noted that the Love numbers are largely frequency independent, an exception occurs 
near a frequency corresponding to the K1 tide constituents due to a resonance in the liquid core 
[Wahr, 1985 and Stacey, 1977].  
The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR computes the solid earth tide, or body tide, as a purely radial elastic 
response of the solid Earth to the tidal potential (see parameter solid_earth_tide.) The adopted 
tidal potential is the Cartwright and Tayler [1971] and Cartwright and Edden [1973] tidal potential 
extrapolated to the 2000 era, and includes degree 2 and 3 coefficients of the tidal potential. The 
permanent tide (zero frequency) term is excluded from the tidal potential that is used to compute 
the solid earth tide parameter for the SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR. The elastic response is modeled 
using frequency independent Love numbers. The effects of the resonance in the core are accounted 
for by scaling the tide potential amplitude of the K1 tidal coefficient and some neighboring nodal 
terms by an appropriate scale factor.  
5.9.4. Pole Tide 
The pole tide is a tide-like motion of the ocean surface that is a response of both the solid Earth 
and the oceans to the centrifugal potential that is generated by small perturbations to the Earth's 
rotation axis. These perturbations primarily occur at periods of 433 days (called the Chandler 
wobble) and annual. These periods are long enough for the pole tide displacement to be considered 
to be in equilibrium with the forcing centrifugal potential. The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides a 
single field for the radial geocentric pole tide displacement of the ocean surface (see pole_tide 
parameter), and includes the radial pole tide displacement of the solid Earth and the oceans.  
The pole tide is easily computed as described in Wahr [1985]. Modeling the pole tide requires 
knowledge of proportionality constants, the so-called Love numbers, and a time series of 
perturbations to the Earth's rotation axis, a quantity that is now measured routinely with space 
techniques. Note that the pole tide on the IGDR and GDR may differ, since the pole tide on the GDR 
is computed with a more accurate time series of the Earth's rotation axis. 
5.10. Inverse Barometer Effect 
5.10.1. Inverted Barometer Correction 
As atmospheric pressure increases and decreases, the sea surface tends to respond hydrostatically, 
falling or rising respectively. Generally, a 1-mbar increase in atmospheric pressure depresses the 
sea surface by about 1 cm. This effect is referred to as the inverse barometer (IB) effect. 
The instantaneous IB effect on sea surface height in millimeters (see parameter inv_bar_corr) is 
computed from the surface atmospheric pressure, Patm in mbar:  
inv_bar_corr = 
P)
 - 
(P
-9.948
atm
∗
 
where P is the time varying mean of the global surface atmospheric pressure over the oceans.  
The scale factor 9.948 is based on the empirical value [Wunsch, 1972] of the IB response at mid 
latitudes. Some researchers use other values. Note that the surface atmospheric pressure is also 
proportional to the dry tropospheric correction, and so the parameter inv_bar_corr approximately 
changes by 4 to 5 mm as model_dry_tropo_corr changes by 1 mm (assuming a constant mean global 
surface pressure). The uncertainty of the ECMWF atmospheric pressure products is somewhat 
dependent on location. Typical errors vary from 1 mbar in the northern Atlantic Ocean to a few 
 
SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  
 
Iss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 
59 
 
 
 
mbars in the southern Pacific Ocean. A 1-mbar error in pressure translates into a 10 mm error in the 
computation of the IB effect. 
Note that the time varying mean global pressure over the oceans, P, during the first eight years of 
the T/P mission had a mean value of approximately 1010.9 mbar, with an annual variation around 
this mean of approximately 0.6 mbar. However, the T/P data products provided a static inverse 
barometer correction referenced to a constant mean pressure of 1013.3 mbar. 
IB(T/P) = 
1013.3)
 - 
(P
-9.948
atm
∗
 
Sea surface heights that are generated after applying an inverse barometer correction referenced 
to a mean pressure of 1013.3 mbar are therefore approximately -9.948*(1010.9-1013.3) = 23.9 mm 
lower than those that are generated after applying an inverse barometer correction referenced to a 
time varying global mean pressure, and the difference between the two sea surface heights has an 
annual variation of approximately 9.948*0.6 = 6 mm.  
5.10.2. Barotropic/Baroclinic Response to Atmospheric Forcing 
The High Frequency Wind and Pressure Response correction, hf_fluctuations_corr, complements the 
Inverted Barometer (IB) correction. Like both tides and IB, the ocean response to wind and pressure 
(after removing the IB part) has energy at periods higher than the 20 day implied by the 35-day 
repeat cycle of SARAL/AltiKa. This correction can be thought of as a departure from the IB response 
to pressure, although strictly it is the difference between the response to wind and pressure minus 
the IB. Ali and Zlotnicki [2000] compute this response with a barotropic model that is forced by 
NCEP operational wind and pressure. The model output is filtered in time to pass frequencies 
shorter than 20 days. See also Stammer et al. [1999] and Tierney et al. [2000]. 
The parameter hf_fluctuations_corr is provided in the (I)GDR products as a correction to the inverse 
barometer correction inv_bar_corr. 
5.11. Sigma 0 
The backscatter coefficient, sigma0 Ka values (see parameters sig0), reported on the (O)(I)GDR are 
corrected for atmospheric attenuation using atmos_corr_sig0. Note that "unbiased" sigma0 values 
are recorded on the SARAL/AltiKa data products. For some geophysical algorithms, an appropriate 
bias is applied to the provided sigma. These biases have been determined from comparisons to 
Jason-1 or Jason-2 sigma0. 
Disclaimer : the SARAL altimeter use a Ka band which is new for nadir altimeter. It is worth 
recalling that Ka band is highly sensitive to the rain and cloud attenuation. It was  not possible 
to assess precisely the impact on the sigma naught before launch. User are so advised to use 
this parameter with care.  
 
5.12. Wind Speed 
The model functions developed to date for altimeter wind speed have all been purely empirical. 
The model function establishes a relation between the wind speed, and the sea surface backscatter 
coefficient and significant wave height. A wind speed is calculated through a mathematical 
relationship with the Ka-band backscatter coefficient and the significant wave height (see 
wind_speed_alt) using the Gourrion algorithm. The wind speed model function is evaluated for 10 
meter above the sea surface, and is considered to be accurate to 2 m/s.

Disclaimer : Users should use this parameter carefully because the altimeter wind speed 
algorithm has been tuned on Jason-1 data and should be recalculated with at least one year of 
SARAL/Altika data. 
 
A 10-meter (above surface) wind vector (in east-west and north-south directions) is also provided on 
the SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR (see parameters wind_speed_model_u and wind_speed_model_v). This 
wind speed vector is determined from an interpolation of the ECMWF model. The best accuracy for 
the wind vector varies from about 2 m/s in magnitude and 20 degrees in direction in the northern 
Atlantic Ocean, to more then 5 m/s and 40 degrees in the southern Pacific Ocean. 
5.13. Bathymetry Information 
The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides a parameter bathymetry that gives the ocean depth or land 
elevation of the data point. Ocean depths have negative values, and land elevations have positive 
values. This parameter is given to allow users to make their own "cut" for ocean depth.

6.1. Data format 
SARAL/AltiKa OGDR, IGDR and GDR products have the same information and format. The only 
difference is related to the auxiliary data used (orbit, meteo files, calibrations, … ). 
Accounting for Jason-2 heritage, products are split into three data sets : 
• 
“SSHA” data set : One file close to Jason-2 NRT-SSHA, limited to 1Hz sampling values 
• 
“GDR” data set : One file close to Jason-2 IGDR, containing 1Hz and 40Hz values  
• 
“SGDR” data set : One file close to Jason-2 SGDR, containing 1Hz, 40hz and waveforms 
values 
The following figure shows the data sets available for each kind of product.

6.1.1. NetCdf format and CF convention 
 
The netCDF data format has been chosen to store the different data sets (one file per data set). 
This format is extremely flexible, self describing and has been adopted as a de-facto standard for 
many operational oceanography systems. What’s more, the files follow the Climate and Forecast 
NetCDF conventions CF-1.1 because these conventions provide a practical standard for storing. 
6.1.2. The NetCDF Data Model 
A netCDF file contains dimensions, variables, and attributes, which all have both a name by which 
they are identified. These components can be used together to capture the meaning of data and 
relations among data fields in an array-oriented data set. 
6.1.2.1. Dimensions 
A dimension may be used to represent a real physical dimension, for example, time, latitude, 
longitude, or height. A dimension might also be used to index other quantities (waveforms index for 
example). The following dimensions are used in the SARAL/AltiKa product files:

Table 15 - Dimensions used in the SARAL/AltiKa data sets 
6.1.2.2. Variables 
Variables are used to store the bulk of the data in a netCDF file. A variable represents an array of 
values of the same type. A scalar value is treated as a 0-dimensional array. A variable has a name, a 
data type, and a shape described by its list of dimensions specified when the variable is created. A 
variable may also have associated attributes, which may be added, deleted or changed after the 
variable is created. 
A variable data type is one of a small set of netCDF types. In this document the variable types will 
be represent as follows:

6.1.2.3. Coordinate variables and auxiliary coordinate variables 
A variable with the same name as a dimension is called a coordinate variable. It typically defines a 
physical coordinate corresponding to that dimension. In accordance with the Climate and Forecast 
conventions, we must declare a coordinate variable for each dimension. What’s more, missing 
values are not allowed in coordinate variables and they must be strictly monotonic. 
An auxiliary coordinate variable is a netCDF variable that contains coordinates data but is not a 
coordinate variable as defined above. Unlike coordinate variables, there is no relationship between 
the name of an auxiliary coordinate variable and the name(s) of its dimension(s). 
6.1.2.4. Attributes 
NetCDF attributes are used to store data about the data (ancillary data or metadata), similar in 
many ways to the information stored in data dictionaries and schema in conventional database 
systems. Most attributes provide information about a specific variable. These are identified by the 
name of that variable, together with the name of the attribute. 
Some attributes provide information about the data set as a whole. They are called global 
attributes - similar to the header of the Jason-1 products. 
The following table shows the variable attributes used in the SARAL/AltiKa product. There are no 
mandatory attributes.

6.1.3. The Common Data Language 
The Common Data Language (CDL) is used to describe the content of a data set.

The CDL is textual notation that described the netCDF object and it is human readable. The netCDF 
utility ncdump converts netCDF objects binary to CDL text. The netCDF utility ncgen creates 
netCDF binary file from CDL text file. 
A CDL description of a netCDF data set takes the form: 
netCDF name { 
 dimension: … 
 variables: … 
 data: … 
} 
 
where the name is used only as a default in constructing file names by the ncgen utility. The CDL 
description consists of three optional parts, introduced by the keywords dimensions variables and 
data. NetCDF dimension declarations appear after the dimensions keyword, netCDF variables and 
attributes are defined after the variables keyword and variable data assignments appears after the 
data keyword. CDL statement are terminated by a semicolon. Spaces, tabs and newlines can be 
used freely for readability. Comments in CDL follow the characters ‘//’ on any line.

6.4. Software 
This section lists some software that may be used to browse and use data from SSHA, GDR and SGDR 
data sets. 
6.4.1. Software provided with netCDF : “ncdump” 
 « ncdump » converts netCDF files to ASCII form (CDL) 
See http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/ncdump-man-1.html 
The main options are the following : 
-h  
Show only the header information in the output, that is the declarations of 
dimensions, variables, and attributes but no data values for any variables 
-c  
Show the values of coordinate variables (variables that are also dimensions) as 
well as the declarations of all dimensions, variables, and attribute values 
-v var1,...,varn  The output will include data values for the specified variables, in addition to 
the declarations of all dimensions, variables, and attributes 
-x var1,...,varn  Output XML (NcML) instead of CDL. The NcML does not include data values 
6.4.2. Additional general software 
6.4.2.1. ncbrowse 
“ncBrowse” is a Java application that provides flexible, interactive graphical displays of data and 
attributes from a wide range of netCDF data file conventions. 
See http://www.epic.noaa.gov/java/ncBrowse/ 
6.4.2.2. netCDF Operator (NCO) 
The netCDF Operators, or “NCO”, are a suite of programs known as operators. Each operator is a 
standalone, command line program which is executed at the UNIX shell-level, like, e.g., ls or 
mkdir. The operators take netCDF files as input, then perform a set of operations (e.g., deriving 
new data, averaging, hyperslabbing, or metadata manipulation) and produce a netCDF file as 
output. The operators are primarily designed to aid manipulation and analysis of gridded scientific 
data. The single command style of NCO allows users to manipulate and analyze files interactively 
and with simple scripts, avoiding the overhead (and some of the power) of a higher level 
programming environment. 
See http://nco.sourceforge.net/ 
6.4.3.  Additional specific software : “BRAT” 
The “Basic Radar Altimetry Toolbox” is a collection of tools and tutorial documents designed to 
facilitate the use of radar altimetry data. It is able to read most distributed radar altimetry data 
from all the satellites, to do some processing, data editing and statistic over them, and to visualise 
the results. The Basic Radar Altimetry Toolbox is able to read ERS-1 and 2, TOPEX/Poseidon, 
GEOSAT Follow-on, Jason-1, Jason-2, ENVISAT, SARAL/AltiKa and CRYOSAT-2 missions altimetry 
data from official data centers (ESA, NASA/JPL, CNES/AVISO, NOAA, ISRO), and this for different 
processing levels, from level 1B (Sensor Geophysical Data Record) to level 3/4 (gridded merged 
data).
