SUMMARY 
 
This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) describes algorithms for 
retrieval of ocean surface wind vector from Oceansat-2 Scatterometer data. The ATBD 
contains three major algorithms for derivation of wind vector solutions, directional 
ambiguity removal and rain flagging. It also describes two crucial aspects specific to 
Oceansat-2, firstly, the development of Geophysical Model Functions (GMF) needed for 
wind vector retrieval and secondly, the development of rain impact model necessary for 
rain flagging. In order to realize retrieval as well as flagging, requirements of different 
types of global data sets are also specified along with its utilization procedures. 
For deriving wind vector solutions, a new and efficient algorithm has been 
developed which is as good as Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) algorithm being 
used operationally for the earlier and ongoing global scatterometer missions. The 
algorithm developed for directional ambiguity removal is based on median filter and it 
operates in two stages considering observational data at different spatial coverage in order 
to tackle the localized ambiguities also. The rain flagging algorithm makes use of the cost 
function developed for wind solution extraction which gets modified under rain free and 
rainy situations. The sea-ice flagging approach is adopted from the literature which is 
used for sea-ice detection from Quikscat data. The present ATBD describes the 
procedures for developing GMF specific to Oceansat-2 scatterometer by using 
simultaneous observations of radar backscatter from Oceansat-2 and reanalysis wind 
vector fields from AGCM (atmospheric general circulation model - ECMWF)  for rain 
free conditions using rain information from TRMM or DMSP-SSM/I. Like-wise, 
procedures for rain impact model development are also described in ATBD based on 
atmospheric attenuation and rain fall to be available from TRMM-PR along with 
Oceansat-2 scatterometer radar backscatter and model analysis wind data.  
Analysis of limited data of Quikscat scatterometer, sensitivity studies related to 
wind vector retrieval using both the algorithms (MLE and in-house), rain and sea ice 
flagging, assumptions made in algorithms and various procedures, and overall limitations 
of retrievals are also presented.

1.0 Introduction: 
 
  
The ocean surface wind is the main driving force for ocean circulation and for 
generation of surface waves and currents. It plays an important role in air-sea interaction, 
upwelling, biogeochemical transport in the ocean and several other processes.  The ocean 
surface wind vector is an essential input parameter for prediction models of ocean 
circulation and waves, which are used for oceanographic applications and climate related 
studies.  It is also an indispensable parameter along with a few others, for the prediction 
of storm surges caused by storms formed in the oceans, which hit the coasts causing 
disaster in the coastal regions. Besides meteorological applications, ocean surface wind 
provides forcing parameters for studying the ocean general circulation. Scatterometer data 
can also be useful for ocean wave mapping and wave forecasting, offshore activities, ship 
routing, fisheries etc.  Besides, wind vectors from scatterometer, when properly 
assimilated in an appropriate numerical model, helps improving weather forecast. 
Repetitive measurements of surface wind field over global oceans are thus necessary for 
the above studies and applications. 
Wind vectors are usually obtained from microwave scatterometers operating at 
microwave frequencies in 5-14 GHz range.  This part of the spectrum is useful for 
measurements under all weather conditions except heavy precipitation.  However, the 
wind speeds can also be obtained from space-borne microwave radiometers and 
altimeters. Moreover, the upcoming microwave polarimetry is being considered for vector 
wind measurements. 
 
2.0 Scatterometer measurements: 
 
Active microwave remote sensing of ocean surface winds has started since the 
launch of SEASAT in 1978.  This was the first satellite dedicated to the ocean research 
and was an experimental satellite, which demonstrated the retrieval of wind to an 
accuracy of 2 m/s, from wide swath scatterometer. ERS-1 & 2 satellites were launched 
with C-band microwave scatterometers. Japanese satellite ADEOS-1 carried a Ku-band 
scatterometer. Pencil-beam scatterometers operating at Ku-band were launched onboard 
ADEOS-2 and Quikscat satellites. Quikscat scatterometer is currently in orbit. A similar 
pencil-beam scatterometer operating at Ku band is due for launch onboard Indian satellite 
Oceansat-2 satellite.

Scatterometer is an active microwave instrument (radar), which measures the 
microwave energy backscattered from an area over the earth’s surface illuminated by it. 
From the known transmitted and backscattered energy along with measurement geometry 
and other sensor related parameters, the radar backscatter coefficient or the normalized 
radar cross section (NRCS) symbolized as σ0 (sigma naught) is derived. The σ0 
measurements over the ocean are used for wind vector determination. The philosophy of 
wind retrieval is discussed later, however, multiple measurements of backscatter are 
required for this purpose and scatterometers are designed to realize the same with 
multiple beams (antennae) in configurations like fan-beam or pencil-beam. 
The fan-beam type employs two or more single or dual polarization antennae and 
has maximum azimuth separation of 90 degrees like those launched onboard Seasat, ERS-
1/2 and ADEOS-1 satellites. The pencil beam type scatterometers observe radar 
backscatter at different azimuth separation angles like those launched onboard ADEOS-2 
and Quikscat satellites. Retrieval of the surface wind vector in terms of speed and 
direction takes place using these so called 'triplets', 'quadruplets' or multiple of radar 
backscatter through a model known as Geophysical Model Function (GMF) which relates 
polarized backscatter with wind speed, wind direction and observational geometry. 
 
3.0 Oceansat-2 scatterometer system: 
 
Oceansat-2 satellite in sun-synchronous orbit at 720 km altitude will carry a Ku-
band microwave scatterometer (SCAT) and an Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM). The 
satellite will have two days repeat cycle with equator descending time around noon.  
The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed 
assembly to generate the two beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the 
entire swath. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of ~ 49° and the outer beam 
makes an incidence angle of ~ 57° on the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 
Km for inner beam and 1840 Km for outer beam respectively. The inner beam is 
configured in horizontal polarization and the outer beam is configured to vertical 
polarization for both transmit and receive modes. The horizontal polarization is chosen 
for inner beam in order to alleviate the low backscatter value problem of horizontal 
polarization at lower wind speeds. This would ensure the reduction in the path loss due to 
the slant range and hence maintains an almost the same SNR for both the inner and outer

Various types of the wind vector cells available from a pencil-beam scatterometer 
are depicted in figure (1b). Due to circular scanning of two beams at fixed incidence 
angles, areas of a particular size cut across the swath contain variable number of 
backscatter measurements impacting the wind retrieval. The entire swath can be divided

Over outer zone, where no measurements from inner beam are available and the 
derived wind solutions do not posses any ranking, the wind retrieval needs external data 
like model winds. Over sweet zone, measurements available from both the beams with 
dual look directions also having good optimal azimuth diversity are very much suitable 
for better wind vector retrieval. Over nadir zone, measurements available from both the 
beams with dual look directions but with non-optimal azimuth diversity lead to more 
erroneous wind vectors. Wind direction ambiguity removal processes for outer and nadir 
zones are different and require special efforts mentioned briefly later.

4.0 Geophysical model functions: 
 
The magnitude of radar backscatter depends upon the sea surface roughness 
generated by the action of winds.  The wind forcing generates a spectrum of surface 
waves in which growth of capillary waves is directly influenced by wind intensity.  The 
basic mechanism at work is the Bragg Resonance, in which the waves satisfying Bragg’s 
condition produce strong radar backscatter energy.  The backscatter signal also depends 
upon the incidence angle of radar beam.  The directional anisotropy of the radar signal, 
caused by the azimuth symmetry of sea surface roughness, yields multiple solutions of 
derived wind vectors (especially direction). Among these, only one solution is “true” and 
remaining solutions are known as directional “ambiguities”.  Multi-beam scatterometer is 
used to overcome this problem of ambiguities to a certain extent. The radar backscatter 
shows a harmonic nature as expressed by (Ulaby et al, 1981, Wentz and Smith, 1999 and 
others)

where,  ϕ is relative wind direction (ϕ = χ- φ), an angle between radar azimuth φ and 
wind direction χ both measured in meteorological convention (clockwise from local 
North direction with a zero degree wind direction representing a wind blowing from 
North to the point of observation). Here, the ocean surface wind speed W is at neutral 
stability height of 10 m. The coefficients Bi are harmonic components with Pi and Qi 
coefficients expressed as functions of polarization p and LQFLGHQFH DQJOH  DW D JLYHQ
radar operating frequency and Nh is the number of harmonics considered. As, so far, the 
observed dependency of radar backscatter on wind conditions has not been well-
explained theoretically, the empirical relationships are established using simultaneous 
measurements of radar backscatter and ocean surface wind vector obtained through model 
analysis as well as insitu measurements. The Geophysical Model Function (GMF) is an 
empirical relationship between radar backscatter and wind vector.  
In equation (1), the non harmonic component (or the constant term) signifies the 
base value of variation of radar backscatter for a given wind speed, incidence angle and 
polarization, the first harmonic represents the upwind-downwind ratio of backscatter 
while second harmonic which is dominant among all other harmonics signifies the 
upwind-crosswind ratio. Though the third harmonic representing the skewness around 
cross wind direction is very small in value but along with the first harmonic, it is very 
important for the wind direction retrieval. 
 
4.1 Prevailing GMF: 
 
There are various GMFs available for Ku-band known as SASS-1, SASS-2, 
NSCAT-1, NSCAT-2, and QSCAT-1. The functional forms of these GMFs are given by 
Schroeder et al, (1982); Wentz, (1994); Wentz and Smith (1999) and Dunbar (1999). As 
an example of the difference among GMFs, the variation of horizontal polarization radar 
backscatter from NSCAT-1 and QSCAT-1 GMFs at different wind speeds is depicted in 
figure (3).

angle of 46 degree using different GMFs, (a) NSCAT-1, (b) QSCAT-1 
 
It is important to note that these GMFs are system specific and vary from system 
to system. Hence, these GMFs are required to be redeveloped or refined for an 
independently designed scatterometer system. 
 
4.2 GMF development procedures: 
 
After normalization with the constant term, the equation (1), considering 
variations in radar backscatter up to third harmonic of wind direction, is rewritten as  
 
0 = A0[1+A1.cos (ϕ)+ A2.cos (2ϕ)+ A3.cos (3ϕ)] 
1a 
 
where, the coefficients Ai are functions of wind speed, incidence angle and polarization. 
In order to determine the coefficient A0 at desired incidence angle, wind speed and 
polarization, the σ0 values for all relative wind direction ϕ varying from 0 to 2π are 
averaged yielding A0 coefficient as the summation of Cos(ϕ), Cos(2ϕ) and Cos(3ϕ) 
vanishes 
A0 = <σ0> 
2 
 
Dividing equation (1a) by A0 on both sides and rearranging the terms we get 
 
  
 
8
Y = A1 Cos(ϕ) + A2 Cos(2ϕ)+ A3 Cos(3ϕ)          where Y = (σ0/A0)–1 
3 
 
  
At desired incidence angle, polarization and wind speed, by determining Y at each 
ϕ value, the harmonic coefficients Ai are established through statistical analysis.  This 
procedure yields the GMF coefficients as well as an idea about the scatterometer data 
quality. 
It is important that for each bin of wind speed the wind direction corresponding to 
radar backscatter should have uniform distribution with statistical significance while for 
any bin of relative wind direction the wind speed should have Rayleigh distribution 
(Wentz et al, 1984). Thus, it requires a large database of simultaneous backscatter and 
wind vector measurements in order to meet this requirement for GMF development. 
Moreover, the data should also be for rain free situations requiring simultaneous 
observations of rain. 
As a prelude to GMF development, analysis of Quikscat data (MGDR NRT 
Version in BUFR format at 25 km spatial resolution) for orbit #29820 on March 11, 2005 
at 12.00 GMT is performed. Figure (4) shows the scatter plot of Quikscat radar 
backscatter with relative wind direction obtained making use of NCEP model winds 
provided along with the data.

bins at, (a) 4-6 m/s, (b) 10-11 m/s, (c) 17-18 m/s and (d) 19-20 m/s. 
 
The A0 coefficients for selected wind speed values are derived from the above 
Quikscat data as depicted in figure (5). A comparison of derived A0 from the data set and 
from the Quikscat GMF QSCAT-1 is also depicted. The observed difference between 
GMF and data derived A0 coefficient is quite evident due to incompleteness of the 
observation set.

Due to the non-availability of large data sets of radar backscatter, the above 
exercise with radar backscatter simulated using NSCAT-1 and QSCAT-1 GMFs has been 
performed for wind speed only up to 20 m/s which is the specified range for NSCAT-1. 
The comparison of harmonic coefficients (proxy GMF) established using these two 
GMFs has been performed (Tiwari and Gohil, 2005) as shown in figure (6). The 
difference in two GMFs in terms of harmonic coefficients is quite evident. Moreover, the 
NSCAT-1 and QSCAT-1 GMFs were developed considering two and three harmonics, 
respectively. The comparison reveals the fact that the GMFs are sensor specific.

4.2.1 Post-launch ancillary data requirements for GMF development: 
 
The basic data sets needed are the global observations of radar backscatter from 
Oceansat-2 scatterometer and near concurrent model analysis wind vector data. In order 
to develop GMF for rain free conditions, near concurrent observations of rain is also 
required from other satellites like TRMM-PR/TMI and DMSP-SSM-I. The collection of 
these data sets is planned for about six months from the launch of Oceansat-2 satellite. 
The justification for six month period is that a sufficient data base is required to be 
prepared to cover the widest range of wind speed as well as the entire range of wind 
direction for all wind speed preferably the low and high speed ranges also pertaining to 
rain free situations. The data required for GMF development is reflected in Table (3).

5.0 Wind vector retrieval and the state of art: 
 
The radar backscatter having harmonic dependence on wind direction yields 
multiple solutions of wind vector from a given set of radar backscatter measurements. As 
the radar backscatter is a function of wind speed and direction, two measurements of 
radar backscatter are essentially required to determine wind vector. However, unique 
solutions are not possible due to the harmonic nature of backscatter on wind direction and 
the presence of noise in radar data. Among these multiple wind vector solutions, only one 
solution corresponds to true wind vector while others are ambiguities also known as 
“ aliases”. Although, the wind speed solutions are very close to each other, the direction 
solutions are quite apart. The solutions are prioritized (or ranked) based on certain 
criterion used in algorithm. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated in terms of 
percentage of highest priority (rank-1) solutions correctly identifying the true directions 
out of the total number of data cases processed. 
Under noise-free conditions, the rank-1 solution always represents the true wind 
vector but for noisy or real data, it is always not so.  However, the first two highest 
ranked solutions contain the true direction most of the times.  The selection of vector 
solution nearest to the true wind vector is performed through the directional ambiguity 
removal algorithm. An overall scheme for retrieval of wind vector field is depicted in 
figure (7).

5.1 Algorithm for retrieval of wind vector solutions: 
 
The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) algorithm developed based on 
Bayesian approach is the best algorithm (Chi and Li, 1988), which is widely and 
operationally used for the scatterometer missions launched so far. More so, variants of 
MLE algorithm have also been developed (Stoffelen and Anderson, 1997; Stoffelen and 
Portabella, 2006) with difference in its implementation. In some of the variants of MLE, a 
transformed MLE has also been developed. The algorithm developed recently is based on 
transformed MLE, which is as good as MLE but is computationally efficient. This 
recently developed algorithm is described here. The cost function used in MLE algorithm 
(Pierson, 1989), is given as 
 
MLCF(Wk, χk) = Σ
M 
i=1{(σ0M(φi, θi, pi) - σ0G(Wj, ϕki, θi, pi)) / Kpij.σ0G(Wj, ϕki, θi, pi)}2

Where, σ0M is backscatter measured by ith scatterometer antenna beam at incidence angle 
θi, polarization pi with azimuth direction φi, σ0G is backscatter calculated from GMF for a 
trial wind speed Wj and trial kth wind direction χk, ϕki is relative wind direction taken as 
ϕki = χk- φi and φi is antenna azimuth direction from North direction. 
For an assumed wind direction, the cost function MLCF is minimized by using 
simulated backscatter for varying wind speed Wj with a suitable increment and the 
  
 
14
nonlinear interpolation. The minimum of MLCF is dependent on the wind speed search 
interval.  As smallest is the interval (more computations) precise is the minimum. This 
process can also be realized using individual minimization for which the MLCF is 
transformed from backscatter space to the wind speed space and is referred here as 
normalized variance (NV) given by 
 
NVk = Σ
M 
i=1{(Wki  - Wk) / Kpi Wk}2 
5 
 
Where Wki is a wind speed derived from ith measurement σ0M(φi, θi, pi) while Wk is a best 
(but with errors) wind speed to which all measurements are associated with.  
 
In this recent approach, a given backscatter observation σ0M(φi, θi, pi) is converted 
into wind speed Wki for an assumed wind direction through GMF as 
 
Wki = Wj   such that  σ0M(φi, θi, pi) = σ0G(Wj, ϕki, θi, pi) 
6 
 
 
Here, Wj is varied over the range specified by GMF being used and Wki is obtained 
numerically through linear interpolation of σ0G and Wj (due to its closure form and hence 
efficient). 
The derived wind speed Wki is a sum of true speed WTk and an error WEki which is 
a manifestation of errors in backscatter. The true error in σ0M is unknown but is 
represented by variance of σ0M (communication noise) defined in terms of Kp value 
which can be calculated using model backscatter (GMF) and the sensor parameters α, β 
and γ (Fischer, 1972; Long and Mendel, 1991; Oliphant and Long, 1999) as 
 
Kpi = √((γi / σ0G
i 
2) + (βi / σ0G
i) +α i } 
7 
 
Thus assuming WEki = Kpi.WTk, the Wki can be redefined considering the 
backscatter variance as 
 
Wki = WTk(1+ Kpi) 
8 
  
 
15
 
Using M number of σ0M measurements, the backscatter variance-weighted mean 
of derived wind speed for trial wind direction χK is defined as 
 
Wk = Σ
M 
i=1{Wki /(1+Kpi)} / Σ
M 
i=1{1 /(1+Kpi)} 
9 
 
Since Wki is calculated assuming σ0G
 = σ0M, the Kpi value cannot be calculated 
from σ0M. For this reason, all Kpi values are first initialized to zero, and then Wki and 
corresponding Kpi are calculated through GMF using equations (4) and (2), respectively. 
The Wk is recalculated using the updated values of Kpi, and the procedure is repeated till 
Wk is converged yielding final Kpi and Wk.  
Since Kp value is already used in Wk, ignoring Kp in equation (5) yields NV as  
 
NVk = Σ
M 
i=1{(Wki  - Wk) / Wk}2 
10 
 
The above term can also be expressed as normalized standard deviation (NSD) 
and standard deviation (SD) of wind speed derived from backscatter measurements as 
given below 
 
NSDk = (1/Wk)√[(1/M) Σ
M 
i=1(Wki  - Wk)2] 
11 
 
SDk = √[(1/M) Σ
M 
i=1(Wki  - Wk)2] 
12 
 
The present algorithm referred as NSDA makes use of parameter NSD for 
deriving as well as for ranking the wind vector solutions. As NSD or SD are obtained 
from Wki values which are derivable due to their closure form for a given trial direction, 
this approach becomes very efficient (Chi and Li, 1988). Based on SD without 
considering the measurement variance, an algorithm developed in-house was used for 
  
 
16
SEASAT-A and ERS-1 scatterometers (Gohil and Pandey, 1985; Gohil, 1992; Gohil and 
Pandey, 1995). Retrieval algorithm using NSD ignoring Kp value was developed and 
tested with Quikscat data (Gohil et al, 2006). In the present study, NSD considering the 
Kp value is used for ranking the solutions. The parameter SD is used for rain flagging 
discussed later. A block diagram of algorithm for retrieving wind vector solutions is given 
in figure (8).

5.1.1 Implementation of retrieval algorithms: 
 
The NSDA is implemented in following steps: 
 
1) First, assume δχ as 2°. For χ=0°, calculate wind speed WS1i using equation (6) 
for the “ ith” backscatter measurement by varying wind speed over full GMF range with 
interval δWS1 (1.0 m/s). Using all WS1i, also find the weighted mean Wm and the 
normalized standard deviation NSD values from equations (9) and (11), respectively,  
2) Truncating WS1i with 1.0 m/s precision denoted by WStrnci, evaluate wind 
speed regimes ∆WS1i separately for all the beams using the following equation  
 
∆WS1i = WStrnci ± δWS1.δχ 
13 
 
  
 
17
3) Repeat steps (1 and 2) using ∆WS1i for the remaining trial directions 
4) Find vector solutions by searching minima of NSD along χ yielding NS 
solutions with Wn
m wind speed and χn direction and the corresponding NSDn values 
5) Find precision direction solution χn
prcn through calculating minimum of 
quadratic fit of NSDn values obtained for χ varied between χn±δχ with 1° trial direction 
interval starting with wind speed search regime ∆WS1i at χn-δχ trial direction 
6) At precision direction solutions χn
prcn, find Wn
m and NSDn through step 2 
exploiting ∆WS1i values at χn-δχ trial direction. The derived precision solutions of wind 
speed, direction and corresponding NSD are denoted by Wn
mprcn, χn
prcn and NSDn
prcn, 
respectively 
7) Rank the wind vector solutions on the basis of NSD values. The wind vector 
solution having minimum NSD is ranked as rank-1 solution and so on. 
 
For comparison purpose, the MLE algorithm is also implemented in following 
steps: 
1) First, assume a trial wind direction interval of 2°, denoted by δχ. For χ=0°, find 
wind speed denoted by WS1 corresponding to minimum MLCF determined as per 
equation (4) using wind speed varied over full GMF range with 1.0 m/s interval denoted 
by δWS1. 
2) Evaluate wind speed regime ∆WS1 from WS1 using the following equation.  
 
∆WS1 = WS1 ± 2δWS1. δχ 
14 
 
3) Find wind speed denoted by WS2 through searching MLCF minimum using 
wind speed regime ∆WS1with 0.2 m/s wind speed interval termed as δWS2. 
4) Find precision wind speed WS2prcn through minimum of quadratic fit of MLCF 
around WS2 with winds between WS2 ± δWS2 and recalculate MLCF2prcn for WS2prcn at 
χ=0°. 
5) Truncate WS2prcn with 0.2 m/s precision denoted by WStrnc and find the wind 
speed regime for the next trial direction χ is given as 
 
∆WS2 = WStrnc ± 2δWS2. δχ 
15 
  
 
18
 
6) Repeat steps (3 through 5) for the remaining trial directions varied with an 
interval δχ with wind corresponding to wind speed regimes given by equation (14). 
7) Find vector solutions by searching minima of MLCF2prcn along trial direction. 
Denote number of solutions as NS and their serial numbers as n. The solutions of wind 
speed, direction and the corresponding MLCF thus obtained are denoted by WSn, χn and 
MLCFn, respectively, where n varies from 1 to NS. 
8) Find precision direction solution χn
prcn around χn by finding minimum of 
MLCF2prcn through quadratic fit of MLCF2prcn values calculated for χ varied between χn 
and χn ±3δχ with 1° direction interval. 
9) Find WSn
prcn and MLCFn
prcn at the precision direction solution χn
prcn following 
steps (3 through 5) exploiting the wind speed regime of (χn - δχ)th trial direction. 
10) Repeat step 9 for all NS solutions. 
11) Rank wind vector solutions on the basis of MLCF values. The wind vector 
solution having minimum MLCF is ranked as rank-1 solution and so on. 
In step 8 for MLE and steps 5 and 6 for NSD implementations, the continuity of 
the trial direction (circular data) and associated parameters around upwind direction is 
maintained. The above schemes are found to be effective in finding precise solutions not 
only for maintaining the direction retrieval skill of the algorithm under varying δχ (finer 
to coarser) and for minimizing the artifacts of search intervals and quadratic fitting but 
also for enhancing the computational efficiency. The typical values of search intervals 
mentioned above are optimized based on the noise free cases considering the entire inner 
beam swath including nadir region. The litmus test for proper implementation of the 
algorithm is that the retrieval skill for the noise free cases must be 100%. The condition 
shown by expression (13) is effective in the situations when coarser search intervals of 
trial direction are used. However, the coarser δχ should be avoided due to possibility of 
missing proper solutions specifically over the nadir region and the retrieval becomes less 
computationally efficient. Moreover, δWS2 also cannot be increased in order to retain the 
accuracy of quadratic interpolation. The optimization of search interval, to some extent, 
also depends upon the intervals of wind speed and direction specified in GMF. The values 
of search intervals δχ and δWS1 mentioned above are optimized based on the QSCAT-1 
GMF. 
  
 
19
Based on simulations, primarily the evaluation of performances of the proposed 
algorithm in successfully retrieving the wind direction under varying noise conditions has 
been carried out for the inner beam data swath region including nadir region. In order to 
carry out simulation studies, radar backscatter data for Quikscat scatterometer 
observational geometry is simulated with orbital altitude of 803 km and local incidence 
angles of 46° and 54° at the earth’s surface with horizontal and vertical polarization, 
respectively. The outer beam swath is divided in a number of wind vector cells (WVC), 
and for each cell, azimuth angle with respect to sub-satellite track is calculated for each of 
the antenna beams pointing to the cell. The cells with only four beams are used for the 
simulation studies. At these WVC, radar backscatter data are simulated using QSCAT-1 
geophysical model function (rsd@zephyr2.jpl.nasa.gov) for simulated wind vector with 
wind speed and direction values varied within the specifications of QSCAT-1 GMF. The 
details of QSCAT-1 GMF are available online (Dunbar, 1999). The GMF backscatter 
value for any relative wind vector and incidence angle within GMF specifications can be 
obtained through bi-linear interpolation. The modification of simulated backscatter due to 
rain is realized through the rain model (Draper and Long, 2004) yielding the path 
integrated attenuation PIA and the lump rain backscatter contribution σ0
rw as functions of 
integrated rain rate R expressed in  km.mm/hr as 
 
 
σ0
r  = e-PIA.σ0
g  + σ0
rw 
16 
 
Based on Quikscat data (25 km BUFR Format) for one orbit, the most prevalent 
values of α, β and γ with their respective standard deviations are used for simulating 
noisy backscatter data for testing the algorithms. These parameters, in general, are 
expressed here as  
 
Y(j) = Ym + V(j) 
17 
 
where Y may be α, β or γ, with Ym as respective mean representative value. The Gausian 
random variable V(j) has zero mean and standard deviation as observed in Quikscat data 
given in table (4).

For each case of wind vector cell, wind vector and antenna beam, the values of α, 
β and γ are generated to simulate the noisy backscatter (Oliphant and Long, 1999) as  
 
σ0Mi = σ0G
i (1+Kpi.Xi) 
18 
 
where Xi is another independent Gausian random number with zero mean and the 
standard deviation K. The value of standard deviation K is normally unity, however, it 
can be varied for controlling the noise in simulation experiment. For noise free case, the 
value of K is zero and for noisy cases, it is varied from 1.0 to 2.0. The Kp is given by 
equation (7). While studying the impact of rain on wind vector retrieval, the rain model is 
used only for simulating the noisy backscatter data but not for the retrieval purpose.  
 
5.1.2 Characteristics of wind retrieval across the inner beam swath: 
 
The simulation experiment carried out for noise free cases provides an insight into 
the characteristics of wind solutions at different locations of the swath. Over the sweet 
zone (Figure 9a) due to the optimum azimuth separation the sensitivity of cost function 
(NSD) with respect to aspect direction is higher. This leads to the retrieval skill relatively 
higher as compared to the other regions due to optimum azimuth separation as well as 
dual polarized multi-look measurements. Over near nadir region, despite dual polarization 
multi-look measurements, the azimuth separation is non-optimal leading to lower 
sensitivity of cost functions as seen in figure (9b) leading to reduced retrieval skill and 
higher errors. At the sub-satellite track, the retrieval skill is approximately halved due to 
  
 
21
pairing of solutions in terms of ranking criterion as seen in figure (9c). The retrieval 
errors are also more due to non-optimal azimuth separation.

5.1.3 Comparison of retrieval algorithms and the noise sensitivity: 
 
The retrieval performance (or skill) of an algorithm for a particularly ranked (first, 
second, etc) solution is defined in terms of percentage of total number of simulated wind 
vectors bearing that particular rank are closest to the wind directions used in simulating 
the radar backscatter data through GMF. Algorithm implementation is verified by 
observing 100 percent skill of top ranked solutions for noise-free condition (K=0) also 
with even and odd intervals of trial direction for retrievals as well as for simulating 
backscatter data. For MLE algorithm a small GMF modeling error (1.0e-14) is used to 
avoid division by zero in MLCF calculations. For the swath location exactly at the sub-
satellite track where azimuth separation is 180, the skill is 50% irrespective of the 
algorithm as pairing of solutions takes place with the same ranking.  
  
 
22
The performances of MLE and NSD algorithms are evaluated for K=1.5 as 
depicted in figure (10a). The skill is evaluated separately for each wind vector cell 
(WVC) location numbered from 1 to 37 across the swath. The WVC numbered 19 
corresponds to the sub-satellite track position. The algorithm skill for each WVC is 
evaluated using wind vector cases with wind speed varying from 1 to 25 m/s with 2 m/s 
interval and wind direction varying from 0° to 354° with 6° interval yielding total 780 
data points. The backscatter data are perturbed with noise controlled by parameter K with 
GMF modeling error of 1.0e-14. It is also observed from figure (10a) for K=1.5 that MLE 
and NSD algorithms have almost equal performances. The retrieval errors in wind speed 
and direction of both the algorithms as shown are found to be almost comparable. Apart 
from this, comparison of distribution of directions retrieved using these algorithms is also 
performed as shown in figure (10b) and is also found to be mostly similar.  
                         
 
 
Figure 10: Characteristics of MLE and NSD algorithms, a) Comparison of direction 
retrieval skills and wind vector errors, b) Distribution of derived wind direction 
solution closest to the true direction, (c) Comparison of algorithms’ performances 
and errors under varying noise conditions 
  
 
23
 
Apart from comparison of performance of NSDA and MLE algorithms across the 
inner beam swath, impact of noise on retrieval performance has also been studied. Figure 
(10c) depicts the comparison of performances and errors of NSD and MLE algorithms 
under varying noise conditions for all the WVC indicating similarity of these algorithms.  
Thus, NSD algorithm is found be as good as MLE algorithm in respect of 
direction retrieval skill, wind vector errors and distribution of retrieved directions thus 
providing an alternative to MLE but with better computational efficiency. However, the 
errors in nadir regions are required to be improved using DIRTH algorithm developed by 
Stiles et al (2002). 
 
5.2 Algorithm for directional ambiguity removal: 
 
A block diagram of directional ambiguity removal algorithm is depicted in figure 
(11). The ambiguity removal algorithm utilizes all the vector solutions available from 
retrieval algorithm over the data locations within the swath and the ambiguity is removed 
based on the trend or the consensus of the rank-1 wind directions solutions over that area. 
In most of the cases, about over half of the rank-1 wind directions are found to be aligned 
in the true wind directional pattern under normal noise conditions while the remaining 
rank-1 directions are mostly in the opposite direction. A median filtering approach is used 
to remove directional ambiguities.

24
For this purpose, the rank-1 vectors over an area are first resolved into scalar 
components.  With a moving window of optimized size, medians of both the scalars at 
each data location are determined using all the points falling within the window.  The 
medians of respective scalars are used to find the median wind direction at each data 
location. Making use of median direction, all the direction solutions at that point are 
examined and the direction solution closest to median direction is identified and that 
vector is assigned as rank-1 solution swapping with its original ranking (Gohil, 1992). 
The procedure is followed for all the points in a scene cut out of the satellite pass and 
likewise the entire pass is processed. The filtering process for a scene is repeated in the 
above-mentioned manner till the entire processed wind field of that scene is converged.  
At this stage, the resulting wind field mostly resembles the true wind field in that scene.  
It is important to note that the retrieval of ambiguity filtered wind vector field is 
mainly dependent on the amount of noise present in radar backscatter data as well as on 
its spatial distribution.  
 
5.2.1 Algorithm for localized directional ambiguity removal: 
 
In case when the scatterometer data is highly noisy over certain parts of the swath, 
the resulting wind field still may have localized ambiguities, which may not always be 
possible to be removed by the filtering process alone. Highly localized ambiguities may 
still be removed using a filtering process over coarser spatial resolution data prepared 
from the given data. In this method, the filtered wind field with localized ambiguities is 
further divided into small segments. Medians of the same ranking solutions for these 
coarser resolution data are obtained. The median solutions for these segments are further 
processed for ambiguity filtering as mentioned above. Based on filtered median wind 
field, the original ambiguity filtered wind field with localized ambiguity is corrected to 
yield final filtered wind field (Gohil and Pandey, 1994).  
 
5.2.2 Directional ambiguity removal over inner beam swath: 
 
The directional ambiguity removal over the inner beam swath may be performed 
in a usual manner as described above by first ignoring the wind solutions exactly over the 
sub-satellite track. Wind solutions over a very narrow region around sub-satellite track 
being very erroneous are firstly required to be ignored because of the retrieval skill halved 
  
 
25
due to the symmetry of the measurement geometry and the pairing of solutions as 
mentioned in earlier sections. Subsequent to the ambiguity filtering in rest of the inner 
beam swath, wind solutions over the sub-satellite track should then be considered and the 
ambiguity filtering process should be repeated. This approach is crude. However, the 
DIRTH algorithm (Stiles et al, 2002) must be used for the purpose and its implementation 
is being worked out. 
It is important to note that while using pencil-beam scatterometer, a narrow 
region of data swath centered at the sub-satellite track may have many data points with 
wind vector solutions not corresponding to the correct wind direction. This needs special 
processing and also requires external data like model surface analysis/forecast on 
operational basis. More so, in the outer region of the data swath where only two radar 
backscatter observations are available, the ranking of wind vector solutions becomes 
irrelevant while one of the solutions represents true wind direction. This also needs 
external data like numerical weather prediction model winds for ranking the solutions. 
 
5.2.3 Directional ambiguity removal over exclusive outer beam swath: 
 
Over the exclusive outer beam swath region where the backscatter measurements 
from only one beam but in two azimuth directions are available, the wind vector solutions 
do not have any meaningful ranking. Due to this reason, the derived solutions at all data 
locations are assigned rank-1 priority based on the model wind direction and are used 
along with inner beam solutions for ambiguity filtering through normal filter process as 
shown in block diagram of figure (12).

26
In this process, certain weights are assigned to wind solutions depending upon its 
distance from the outer edge of the swath of inner beam, otherwise, ambiguity filter 
process will yield wind field more resembling to the model winds loosing the impact of 
measurements. Further details given by Stiles et al, (2002) are being worked out.  
 
5.2.4 Testing of algorithms with Quikscat data:  
 
The present algorithm has been tested with Quikscat data (MGDR NRT Version 
in BUFR format at 25 km spatial resolution) for one orbit (#29820) on March 11, 2005, at 
12.00 GMT over inner beam swath only. Based on median filter, the directional 
ambiguity is removed using a two-step filtering at given and coarser spatial resolutions. 
Quikscat data derived wind fields using NSD and MLE algorithms are depicted in figures 
(13a) and (13b), respectively.

(NRT BUFR-25 km) over inner beam swath for March 11, 2005 over Indian 
region using, a) NSD algorithm, b) MLE algorithm 
  
 
27
 
The derived winds are found to be very similar to each other as well with those of 
finished product winds (not depicted here). More so, the computational efficiency of the 
present algorithm is found to be higher (about 2 to 3 times) as compared to that of MLE 
algorithm during simulation studies as well as testing with Quikscat data (Gohil et al, 
2006). 
 
6.0 Flagging: 
 
Retrieval of ocean surface wind vector from scatterometer is affected in the 
presence of rain due to modification of measured radar backscatter in two ways. During 
rain, the drops falling on water surface create crater, crown, stalk and ring waves. Out of 
these, ring waves contribute the most towards radar backscatter through Bragg resonance. 
Besides, rain attenuates the radar signal as well as contributes through volume 
backscattering. A study of rain impact on backscatter and associated wind vector retrieval 
is required for rain flagging of backscatter data. 
Due to the directional symmetry of ring waves and the scattering from water drops 
in rain column the backscatter signals are depolarized causing diminishing difference of 
radar backscatter in vertical and horizontal polarizations. However, high intensity winds 
under rain-free conditions also lead to depolarization. The normalized polarization 
difference is found to have a potential for pre-retrieval rain flagging. Under moderate and 
high rain conditions, pre-retrieval rain flagging is feasible. Light rain and high wind 
conditions lead to false/missing rain flagging. The impact of rain is also observed in terms 
of drastic changes in retrieved wind speed and direction. Retrieval of wind vector under 
raining conditions is highly erroneous and mostly renders retrieval meaningless. This 
needs rain affected data to be ignored (or flagged out). In the present study, only rain 
flagging of data using the retrieval algorithm by Gohil et al (2006) has been attempted 
following procedures given by Portabella and Stoffelen (2001) yielding different success 
rates for rain-free and rainy conditions. The rain-flagging scheme has been tested with 
simulated data and the success rate of rain flagging under rain-free and rainy situations 
has been evaluated under different noise scenario. Under rain-free situations it is observed 
that the false reporting of rain cases is significantly low while for rainy cases, the missing 
rain events are, to some extent, high but are comparable with the studies made elsewhere. 
Spatial analysis of real data may further improve flagging. 
  
 
28
 
6.1 Rain impact model and its development: 
 
An empirical rain impact model for QuikSCAT to calculate rain affected radar 
backscatter over ocean is given by Draper and Long (2004) as 
 
 σ0
m = αrain(σ0
wind  + σ0
rainstrike)+ σ0
rain 
19 
 
Where σ0
m is the measured Quikscat backscatter, σ0
wind is the rain-free wind-induced 
radar backscatter, σ0
rainstrike is the surface backscatter perturbation due rain striking the 
ocean surface,
rain
α
 is the two way atmospheric rain attenuation, and σ0
rain is the volume 
scattering due to falling rain droplets. The model is further simplified by summing the 
attenuated surface perturbation and the atmosphere scattering terms, creating a single 
(lump) effective rain backscatter. The resultant rain impact model is 
 
σ0
m = αrain.σ0

where R (km.mm/hr) is integrated rain rate. The σ0
wind information is obtained from 
QSCAT-1 GMF for a known wind vector. Based on the above model, variations of 
atmospheric transmittance (τ=e-α) and lump rain backscatter varying with integrated rain 
rate, for horizontal and vertical polarizations, are depicted in figure (14).

backscatter (dotted lines) with integrated rain for Quikscat scatterometer 
 
It indicates that for both the polarizations, atmospheric transmittance nonlinearly 
decreases while lump rain backscatter nonlinearly increases with increasing rain rate. This 
empirical rain impact model is developed using simultaneously observed radar 
backscatter from Quikscat scatterometer, path integrated attenuation and rain rate profile 
from TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR), oceans surface wind vector from NCEP model 
analysis and the QSCAT-1 GMF. Development of such model specific to Oceansat-2 
scatterometer will be essential in which radar backscatter data from Oceasat-2 
scatterometer will be used along with rain and attenuation information from TRMM-PR 
and model wind data from ECMWF/NCEP. Prior to developing rain impact model, 
development of GMF specific to Oceansat-2 scatterometer will be necessary. The data 
requirements for rain impact model development are the same as reflected in table (3) 
with additional data of path-integrated attenuation from TRMM-PR. 
 
6.2 Impact of rain on wind vector retrieval:  
 
The impact of rain is studied through wind vectors retrieved by the method 
mentioned above by using simulated radar backscatter under rainy conditions obtained 
through equation (20). The impact of rain is observed in terms of drastic changes in 
retrieved wind speed and direction as shown in figures (15). The retrieved wind speed 
  
 
30
below and above 15 m/s are over- and under- estimated, respectively as seen in figure 
(15a), while retrieved directions are aligned towards direction normal to sub-satellite 
track as observed in figure (15b). These observed characteristics under rainy conditions 
are utilized to flag the retrievals under rainy situations as mentioned subsequently.

6.3 Rain flagging: 
 
Retrieval of wind vector under raining conditions is highly erroneous and is 
rendered meaningless. This needs rain affected data to be ignored (or flagged). Under 
very low intensity rain situations, winds can be retrieved with due corrections to 
backscatter through simultaneous retrieval of wind and rain using MLE (Draper and Long 
2004a). Presently, only rain flagging of data using NSD algorithm has been attempted 
following the approach by Portabella and Stoffelen (2001) yielding different success rates 
for rain-free and rainy conditions. For rain flagging, the NSD values under rain-free and 
rainy situations have been compared keeping the observed behavior of the derived wind 
vectors in view. Rain rates from 0 to 50 km.mm/hr with an interval of 10 km.mm/hr are 
considered. The trends of variation of rank-1 SD values under rain-free and rainy 
conditions as shown in figure (16a) are found to be separable, hence, can be used for rain 
flagging. The SD values for rain-free and under low to moderate rain conditions are 
overlapping which primarily lead to such rain events undetected. However, apart from 
this, another useful clue used here is that the retrieved wind directions under rainy 
situations are mostly found to be around directions normal to the sub-satellite track. Thus 
a criterion is chosen to flag out possible raining situations in the data based on the above 
  
 
31
information. The trends of wind speed binned mean and standard deviation of rank-1 SD 
with corresponding wind speed are established for all WVC as shown in figure (16b). The 
nonlinearly fitted mean and standard deviation of rank-1 SD are used for rain flagging 
(Portabella and Stoffelen, 2001). The rank-1 retrieved wind vector solution is assumed to 
be referring to raining condition if the following conditions are satisfied: 1) the retrieved 
wind speed WS1
PRCN is above 7.0 m/s, 2) the difference of retrieved wind direction χ1
PRCN 
with direction normal to sub-satellite track (∆χ1
PRCN) satisfies the condition 
|Cos(∆χ1
PRCN)| ≤ 0.275 and, 3) the difference of observed SD1
PRCN and calculated rain-
free SDRFAVG satisfies the condition ∆SD1
PRCN > 0.7.MSD.SDRFSD, with ∆SD1
PRCN = 
|SD1
PRCN - SDRFAVG|, while SDRFAVG and SDRFSD are given by 
 
SDRFAVG = Σ
3 
Q=0AQ( WS1
PRCN)Q   and   SDRFSD = Σ
3 
Q=0DQ( WS1
PRCN)Q 
23 
 
where, AQ and DQ are the polynomial coefficients for average (solid line through 
“ diamond” symbols) and standard deviation (dotted line through “ plus” symbols) fitted 
curves of SD, respectively, as shown in figure (16b). 
The fitted curves used for calculating SDRFAVG and SDRFSD are shown in figure 
(16b). The threshold multiplier MSD varying from 1.8 to 2.2 is used for rain detection and 
has impact on rain detection under rain-free and rainy situations as shown in figure (16c). 
The above scheme has been tested with simulated data and the performance of rain 
flagging under rain-free and rainy situations has been evaluated as depicted in figure 
(16c). The overall proportionate success is a weighted success considering fractions of 
rain-free (about 90 percent) and rainy (about 10 percent) events at any given time over the 
globe as reported in literature (Portabella and Stoffelen, 2001; Stiles and Yueh, 2002; 
Draper and Long, 2004; Huddleston and Stiles, 2000). For no-rain situations it is 
observed that the false reporting of rain cases is significantly low while for raining cases, 
the missing rain events are, to some extent, high but are comparable with the studies 
made elsewhere (Portabella and Stoffelen, 2001; Huddleston and Stiles, 2000).

6.4 Sea-ice flagging (Brief introduction): 
 
Sea-ice altering the radar backscatter measurements affects the wind retrieval. The 
radar backscattered signal from the earth’s surface is dependent on the roughness at the 
scale of the radar wave length, the incidence angle, and the dielectric properties of the 
surface, which for sea ice means ice salinity, temperature, air inclusion, liquid water 
fraction in snow and ice, and snow cover (Haarpaintner et al, 2004). At low wind speeds, 
horizontal polarization backscatter from the ocean is generally lower than backscatter 
  
 
33
from ice but higher wind speed may produce ambiguities for ice-ocean discrimination 
because ice and ocean may exhibit similar mean backscatter values. Haarpaintner et al 
(2004) have given an approach (referred hereafter as HA) for sea-ice delineation making 
use of active polarization ratio (APR) and radar backscatter values. The APR is given as 
 
APR = (σ0H - σ0V)/ (σ0H + σ0V) 
24 
 
Where σ0H, σ0V are radar backscatter on linear scale. Based on a number of criteria given 
in HA, the ice-flagging scheme is being considered for Oceanat-2 scatterometer. A 
limited number of criteria given in HA used here, are given in table (5). 
 
 Table 5: Ice-ocean thresholds 
Parameter 
Value 
APR 
>-0.02 
V0V 
>-25 dB 
V0H 
>-25 dB 
Data satisfying these conditions is treated as ice
 
Some of the results, on the basis of a limited criterion of HA, obtained from 
Quikscat radar backscatter products (BYU products) are presented here as a preliminary 
effort towards sea-ice flagging for Oceansat-2 (Rao, 2007). Shown in figure (17) are APR 
values obtained using Quikscat data for different dates during year 2000 indicating the 
presence of sea ice.

indicating sea-ice coverage for different dates (a) 11-02-2000, and (b) 17-08-2000 
  
 
34
However, over ocean, some of the spurious data indicating sea-ice are also seen 
which may be due to higher winds as well as APR calculated at the edge of inner beam 
swath. Given here is only an introduction to the activity while detailed plan is being 
worked out separately (not a part of wind retrieval). 
 
7.0 Initial phase validation: 
This aspect to some extent is taken care during GMF development phase which 
will also include limited validation of GMF and the derived winds. However, 
calibration/validation activities are being pursued separately. 
 
8.0 Limitations: 
 
The major limitation is that the retrievals under cyclonic conditions are highly 
erroneous in terms of wind speed and direction as the cyclones are mostly associated with 
rain. This needs cyclonic data to be properly identified and processed in a proper manner 
taking care of rain (simultaneous retrievals). Apart from this, regions with highly variable 
wind fields like fronts, cols, vortices and others in the presence of large noise the 
directional ambiguities may not be properly filtered out. Due to different processes to be 
incorporated for outer and nadir regions, discontinuities in the direction fields may occur 
in some cases.
