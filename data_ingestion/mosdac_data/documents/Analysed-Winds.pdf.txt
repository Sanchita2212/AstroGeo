 
GLOBAL ANALYSED OCEAN SURFACE WIND PRODUCTS 
 
 
Description 
The analysed winds have been generated at 0.50×0.50 interval over the global oceans. For the generation of 
these analysed winds products, we have used (Oceansat-2 SCATterometer) OSCAT data for daily Analysed 
Wind Vector (AWV) and combined OSCAT and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) onboard MetOP-A data 
for generating 12 hourly AWV.  Along with wind vector and wind stress, other parameters of interest, wind 
divergence and vertical component of curl of wind stress have also been computed and provided.  
OSCAT was launched by the ISRO on 23rd September 2009 carrying a Ku band (13.515 GHz) pencil beam 
scatterometer along with two other payloads (Ocean Color Monitor, OCM and Radio Occultation Sounder 
for Atmospheric Studies, ROSA) into a near polar sun-synchronous orbit of 720 km altitude, inclination 
98.250 and the local time of equatorial crossing in the descending node at 12 noon ± 10 minutes. The 
scatterometer (OSCAT) has a repeat cycle of 2-days at incidence angles 48.90 (HH- polarization) and 57.60 
(VV-polarization) and the corresponding swaths are 1400 km and 1840 km respectively with a nominal 
spatial resolution of 50 km. In present study, we have used well Level- 2B (L2B) operational wind products 
(version 1.3, October 2011) from OSCAT available freely from National Remote Sensing Centre 
(www.nrsc.gov.in). 
ASCAT as one of the payloads onboard first Meteorological Operational Platform (MetOP-A), was 
launched by EUMETSAT on 19th October 2006. The ASCAT is a C-band (5.3 GHz) fan beam 
scatterometer with six fan beam antennas providing two swaths 550km wide, located on each side of the 
satellite track, separated by a nadir gap of 700 km.   For operational generation of AWV products, L2B data 
(with 25 km resolution) of ASCAT provided by EUMETSAT’s broadcast system for environmental data 
(EUMETCAST) are being used. 
In order to construct global synoptic wind fields from the along track wind observations (e.g. wind vector 
and wind stress), spatial interpolation of the missing data grids is performed. In our study, we have used  
interpolation algorithm based on simple eight grid averaging technique, known as box averaging 
interpolation. If the growth of wind field over oceans is assumed to be stochastic, the predicted value for a 
missing grid can be fairly specified by the average of surrounding eight grids with equal weights. This 
method is comparatively fast and can be used operationally for all regions and all seasons. 
This box averaging technique is physically applicable only on the scalar spatial functions. Hence, first of all, 
we have prepared gridded data for each of the two (zonal and meridional) components of the wind vectors 
and wind stress. Then the missing grids over global oceans are filled up using the above averaging 
technique. This method iteratively fills up all the missing data grids on global scale. If the number of 
iterations increases after an optimal value, the accuracy in the resultant product decreases. Being a very 
simple iterative interpolation technique, box-averaging method fills up all the missing data grids on NRT 
basis. The method is tested for high gradient of wind fields (e.g. tropical cyclones) and found to produce 
satisfactory results.   
The gridded wind fields are computed in near real time with a delay of 24 hours for daily winds and 12hours 
for 12hourly winds. Every product also contains a log file for the quality of analysed wind products. 
Sometimes, swath data are not available due to unforeseen circumstances, even then analysed fields are 
generated which contains wider gaps or larger spatial interpolation. In such cases, analysed winds may not 
be of good quality and it is mentioned in the Log file. This version is a  test dataset to  provide  insight for 
near real time generation of high spatial and  temporal resolutions at later stage. The data are available at 
MOSDAC 
(http://www.mosdac.gov.in/) 
and 
can 
be 
freely 
distributed

format.
