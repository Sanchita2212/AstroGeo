2.1 Introduction 
ALGORITHMS for the retrieval of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) from ocean color sensors have evolved to a great 
extent over past few decades. Simplest form of the algorithm is based on empirical regression, in which 
chl-a concentration is correlated with the reflectance ratio at blue and green wavelength bands (O’ 
Reilly et al., 1998 & 2000). Empirical-based methods have been used operationally to generate global 
chl-a products from satellites such as Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), SeaViewing Wide Field-of-
View Sensor (SeaWifs), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spetroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared 
Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and so on. Constant improvement has been made in such algorithms 
to increase their accuracy even in low chlorophyll oligotrophic waters [3]. Although reliable and easy 
to implement, retrieval from these global algorithms may not be accurate in all parts of the ocean. 
Empirical algorithms for chl-a retrieval work on the assumption that the remote-sensing reflectance 
(Rrs) is mainly influenced by phytoplankton and its degraded products. However, this assumption does 
not hold for Case-2 waters where the optically active constituents do not covary (Dierssen 2010). Due 
to overlapping nature of absorption spectra of various independently varying constituents, relative 
change in reflectance value at blue and green bands cannot be linked directly to chl-a and therefore, 
results in the failure of empirical methods. Also, during phytoplankton blooms of a particular species, 
the empirical based method fails to accurately retrieve chla. This is because most empirical 
relationships are derived from Case-1 waters constituting a large number of other phytoplankton 
species.  
Another set of algorithms are based on semi analytical (SA) inversions of optical closure relationship 
derived from radiative-transfer theory (Gordon et al., 1988; Carder et al., 1999; Maritorenna et al., 
2002; Lee et al., 2004). The model relates Rrs spectra to the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of a 
water column. The IOPs include (A) total absorption coefficient, which is the sum of absorption by 
seawater (aw), phytoplankton (aph), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) + detritus (acdm); and 
(B) total backscattering coefficient, which includes backscattering by seawater (bbw) and suspended 
particles (bbp). Proper inversion of such model allows accurate retrieval of bio-optical parameters 
including chl-a concentration and various IOPs.

observations were taken in years 2014 and 2015, N = 64 points). 
 
Advantage here is that several parameters can be retrieved simultaneously. To mathematically solve 
SA equation, spectral models for the three IOPs (i.e., aph(λ), acdm(λ), and bbp(λ)) must be known. To 
define spectral absorption of CDOM+detritus (CDM), exponential decay function is used which 
depends on spectral slope “S” whereas, particle backscattering is defined in terms of a power-law 
function of wavelength that depends on exponent “η.” On the other hand, phytoplankton absorption 
is spectrally defined in terms of its specific absorption coefficient, which may vary based on community 
structure and pigment composition. Therefore, complete formulation of a SA algorithm requires 
certain model parameters to be hardcoded. However, these parameters show a nonlinear behavior 
and vary on a global scale. Accuracy of the algorithm, therefore, depends on the accuracy with which 
parameters such as specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton (a∗ph(λ)), spectral slope “S” and 
exponent “η” are defined. If the model parameters are accurate, SA algorithm performs well even in 
Case-2 waters, where optically active constituents modify the light field independently.  
To use the model for any set of wavelengths, major difficulty arises in parametrization of a∗ph(λ) 
(Maritorena et al., 2002). Many researchers have expressed a∗ph(λ) as a representative spectrum for 
doing the inversion„ whereas the coefficient is widely known for its variability. A general 
representation of a∗ ph(λ) should account for its variations due to community structure shifts, pigment 
composition, package effect, and irradiance level (Bricaud et al., 1995; Fujiki et al., 2002). Therefore, 
there is a need to fine-tune the existing SA algorithms in order to account for the variations in specific 
absorption coefficient, which would allow the retrieval of bio-optical parameters (e.g., Chl-a) 
simultaneously in both Case-1 and Case-2 waters. One of the important parameters that affects the 
retrieval of bio-optical constituents, in optically complex waters, is the slope S of acdm(λ). Meler et al. 
2016 explained the distribution of the CDM slope (S) as a function of acdm(440). It is was shown to be 
nonlinearly related to CDM absorption coefficient (Meler et al. 2016; Kowalczuk et al., 2006) and 
governs the spectral shape of acdm(λ). The CDM-absorption affects the attenuation of light in ultraviolet 
(UV) and blue wavelengths thereby shielding the aquatic life from harmful UV radiation (Wei et al., 
2016). In this study, we propose a SA approach with improved CDOM slope estimate for calculating 
bio-optical parameters with good accuracy in optically complex waters.

Datasets 
3.1 NASA Bio-optical marine algorithm datasets (NOMAD) 
The relationship between CDOM slope “S” (1/nm) and CDOM absorption coefficient ag at 443 nm 
was established based on the combined data set of NOMAD and Indian coastal data as shown in Fig-
3 & 4. 
3.2  Validation data set 
Chilika Lagoon is a good site to study optically complex waters. Chilika lagoon on the east coast of 
India (19028’ N – 190 54’ N; 850 06’ E−850 35’ E) is one of the important wetlands in the country and 
is the largest brackish water lagoon in Asia. In the northern side of the lagoon, tributaries of the 
Mahanadi River such as Daya, Nuna, and Bhargavi bring a lot of sediment and freshwater influx with 
terrestrial inputs into the lagoon.

Background and Methodology 
4.1 Bio-Optical Inversion Model  
Gordon developed the first simplified analytical model in 1973 for ocean color applications. The 
model was based on the assumption that most of the scattering takes place in forward direction, 
and the color and shape of the upwelling light field are the consequences of absorption and single 
scattering at large angles (Gordon and Evans, 1993). Based on this assumption number of analytical 
models have been developed. The Rrs in water column is the function of total absorption coefficient 
and backscattering coefficients (Gordon et al., 1988; Morel 1988; Morel and Prieur 1977). The SA 
ocean color models by Gordon et al. 1988, Maritorena et al. 2002, and Garver and Siegel 1997 are 
described below through the following equations:

4.2 Solving the Model 
The above set of equations show that the Rrs is a function of six unknowns S, η, a∗ph(λ), chl, aCDM(λ0), 
and bbp(λ0). The vector θ = [chl, acdm(λ), bbp(λ)] represents variables to be retrieved, whereas φ = 
[a∗ph(λ1)..a∗ph(λN ), S, η] is the vector of modeled parameters. Maritorena et al. 2002 solved the bio-
optical model [known as Garver–Seigel–Maritorena (GSM) algorithm] by minimizing the cost 
function described in (7). The model parameter vector (φ) was optimized from global data set using 
simulated annealing technique. The value of vector φ in the GSM algorithm is kept constant 
throughout the scene which may create a strong bias while solving for the unknown vector (θ), 
especially in optically complex waters. Likewise, Lee et al. [18] proposed quasi-analytical algorithm 
(QAA) for deriving IOPs from Rrs in which he used empirical relations for estimating the parameters 
S and η [see (8) and (9). Limitation of QAA algorithm is with the parameterization of CDM slope S 
[see (8)]. The equation for S makes sense as it exploits the Rrs explicitly, but is not sufficient to deal 
with all kinds of waters, thus affecting the retrieval outcome. In case of optically complex waters, S 
takes much lower value for waters with high CDOM absorption at 443 nm. In addition, the presence 
of other constituents may change the slope value significantly

(10) 
Both GSM and QAA uses SA model described in (1), with the two coefficient g1 and g2 fixed for nadir 
viewing geometry. Many ocean color sensors are looking at the ocean away from nadir to avoid 
sunglint making Rrs to be anisotropic in nature, having an angular distribution (Lee et al., 2004). 
Therefore, an inversion of satellite-derived reflectance with good accuracy using (1), specially for 
coastal waters, have always been a challenging task. 
4.3 ABOM/ABOM2 Model Description 
The basic formalism of QAA (quasi-analytical model) by Lee et al. 2004 has been adopted in analytical 
bio optical model (ABOM) model which accounts for the cumulative response of angular distribution 
of light field and multiple scattering within the water column (due to molecular or particle 
scattering) on the Rrs. The semi-ABOM, similar to GSM, solves the closure relationship between Rrs 
and IOPs using Levenberg–Marquardt technique in a least square sense. Remote-sensing reflectance 
(Rrs), as mentioned earlier, is the function of two vectors θ and φ. The unknown vector θ = [chl, 
acdm(λ), bbp(λ)] is simultaneously derived after modification in known vector φ = [a∗ ph(λ1)..a∗ 
ph(λN ), S, η] parameterization. Set of equations used in ABOM model is summarized in equation 11 
to 15. We have assumed that the absorption due to CDOM dominates over detritus absorption. We 
also corrected for the CDOM slope bias by introducing empirically derived expression for S (Fig. 3), 
details are presented in Section II-D. We also accounted for the variability in a∗ph using its 
dependence on chlorophyll (Bricaud et al., 1995). This whole formulation led to a significant 
improvement in the retrieval outcome.

4.3.1 Model for the Slope of CDOM Absorption 
The empirical relation for CDOM slope was estimated using the extensively calibrated and enhanced 
in situ bio-optical NOMAD (NASA Bio-optical Marine algorithm data version 2.0 ALPHA) data set. 
Based on bathymetric information, all optical data corresponding to locations falling within 50-m 
depth zone, classically defined as case-2 waters, were extracted from NOMAD. The data points from 
NOMAD were filtered on the basis of finite values of available optical parameters like water leaving 
radiance (Lw), surface solar irradiance (Es) etc., with ag available at minimum five wavelengths. Two 
channels for ag are sufficient to estimate CDOM slope S using [20, eq. (13)]; however, more optical 
bands were added to make the filtration process robust in order to reduce the data redundancy 
while retaining its variability. Bio-optical data corresponding to Indian coastal waters collected under 
various in situ campaigns were also merged with NOMAD and the combined data set with 161 
measurements were utilized for model development. Fig. 4 shows the approximate locations of 
these data points. Slope of CDOM (S) was found to be highly variable ranging from 0.007 to 0.05 
nm−1 for the values of reference absorption ag (443) ranging from 0.015 to 0.6 m−1. To account for 
this variability, a power fit was performed as shown in equation (14).

4.4 Discussion and Validation on ABOM 
Water samples from 64 stations were collected during 2014 and 2015 in Chilika lagoon (sampling 
locations shown in Fig. 1) and in situ chl-a were estimated using spectrophotometer. Comparison of 
chlorophyll–a concentration derived using Lee–Morel [8], [21], GSM [7], and ABOM model (this letter) 
in optically complex waters of Chilika Lagoon (see Fig. 5) indicate significant differences among the SA 
models when compared with in situ measurements. The mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD) 
of pooled data set for Lee–Morel and GSM was above 150% while ABOM showed significant 
improvement in reducing the MAPD to 58%. From Table I, it is clear that mean chl-a (10.2 mg/m3) for 
ABOM model is very close to mean in situ chl-a (11.05 mg/m3) unlike to Lee–Morel (27.7 mg/m3) and 
GSM (33.1 mg/m3). In addition to that, a significant improvement in the ABOM model in terms of 
relative bias (6.92%) was observed over Lee–Morel (188.2%) and GSM (167.8%). Slope S of CDM 
(colored dissolved and detrital matter combined) used in Lee–Morel is determined dynamically based 
on an empirical relationship with blue–green ratio.

Fig. 5. Validation of chl-a derived from ABOM (this study), GSM and Lee–Morel models with in situ data 
set. 
However, the parametrization causes the slope to be always greater than 0.015 (1/nm). In optically 
complex waters, the contribution of CDOM and detrital matter to absorption in blue wavelengths is 
significant and independent. Higher absorption in reference wavelength due to CDOM significantly 
decreases the slope value (less than 0.01, this study). Therefore, Lee–Morel does not accurately 
estimate chlorophyll concentration when CDOM is high. In GSM model, the slope value of CDOM 
absorption is kept constant and high (0.02 nm−1) which also creates a strong bias resulting in 
overestimation of chlorophyll concentration. The ABOM model accounts for the low magnitude in 
slope values for higher CDOM absorption in optically complex waters. Although the power function for 
CDOM slope is able to explain only 24%–25% variability in the data set, incorporation of this equation 
in ABOM is able to significantly reduce the uncertainty in the estimation of chlorophyll concentration 
when combined with the model for phytoplankton specific absorption [9]. The model can be further 
improved by incorporating the contribution by detrital absorption at reference wavelength. 
4.5 Discussion and Validation on ABOM2 
The performance of the global models was illustrated in Table 2 for deriving absorption coefficients 
due to coloured dissolved organic matter, detritus and their integrated response at 443nm. The 
limitation of the Lee-Morel-Bricaud model and GSM model is to derive the integrated response of 
CDOM and detritus only with 33% and 30% uncertainty respectively. However, the above limitation 
was partially solved using [22] i.e. the model is capable to derive the absorption coefficient due to 
coloured dissolved organic matter at 443nm with 36% uncertainty in optically complex waters. While 
the new parameterized model is able to address the above described limitations of deriving 
absorption coefficients due to coloured dissolved organic matter, detritus and their integrated 
response at 443nm with 30%, 40% and 29% uncertainties respectively. 
In addition to that, Statistics of the performance of the global models for deriving CDOM (ag), 
detritus (ad) absorption coefficients and their integrated response at 443nm, have been illustrated 
in Table 3. The important point here is to note that the mean values of NASA bio optical marine 
algorithm datasets [NOMAD] for absorption due to CDOM, detritus and their integrated response 
are 0.18 (m−1), 0.06 (m−1) and 0.24 (m−1) respectively. LMB and GSM derived integrated responses 
are 0.21 (m−1) as compared to NOMAD i.e. 0.24 (m−1) while New model derived response is very 
close to NOMAD i.e. 0.23 (m−1). Further, new model derived individual response i.e. absorption due 
to CDOM and detritus 0.17 (m−1) and 0.06 (m−1) respectively are very close to the mean values of 
NOMAD. Similarly, Gupta et al (2020) also works very well for CDOM showing close proximity to NO- 
MAD mean CDOM at 443nm. 
The integrated response ad+ag at 443nm is slightly underestimated with respect to NOMAD in-situ 
data while other two models like GSM and Lee-Morel-Bricaud are overestimated with respect to 
NOMAD in-situ data as shown in Figure (6). Also, bio-optical model [22] derived only cdom (ag) at 
443nm with slope tending to unity and R-square and RMSE, 0.82 and 0.10, respectively. Whereas, 
the new parameterized model derived cdom and detritus coefficients at 443nm, are much 
underestimated with respect to NOMAD ag and ad at 443nm while their integrated response at 
443nm is slightly better than their individual ones. The approach adopted in the current model for 
the isolation of detritus and CDOM absorption coefficient from remote sensing reflectance is novel 
and can be used globally. Still, there is even much more scope for their further improvements as 
well.

Conclusion 
In this study, ABOM with suitable parameterization has been presented to derive chl-a in optically 
complex waters. In addition, an attempt was made to correct for the CDOM slope bias by introducing 
empirically derived expression in Fig. 3, using NOMAD data for global waters. This study concludes that 
ABOM-derived chl-a (mg/m3) improves significantly with an uncertainty of 58% as compared to GSM 
(175%) and Lee–Bio (189%) algorithms. Further the study reveals the bio-optical models developed for 
global oceans needs to be regionally parameterized for optical components in complex waters bodies 
to accurately estimate the magnitudes of optical constituents.  
Similarly, in ABOM2, the study attempted to bring about improvement in the parameterization of Lee 
inversion model using the global NOMAD in-situ dataset. The parameterization to inversion model 
successfully estimated detritus and CDOM absorption coefficients with uncertainty of 40% and 30%, 
respectively. Also, the integrated response of CDOM and detritus after parameterization, had a lesser 
uncertainty of 29% as compared to GSM and Lee-Morel-Bricaud (LMB) model whose uncertainties 
were 30% and 33%, respectively. Similar results can be obtained globally by introducing a new 
parameterization to inversion model for deriving detritus absorption. This might be quite significant in 
deriving the sub components of inherent optical properties (IOPs) within the acceptable uncertainty.
